# CAO Documentation Site

This directory contains the documentation website for CLI Agent Orchestrator, built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

The site is deployed to https://awslabs.github.io/cli-agent-orchestrator/ via GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

```bash
cd docusaurus
npm install
npm run start
```

This starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000/cli-agent-orchestrator/` with hot reloading.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates static content into the `build` directory.

## Adding Documentation

1. Add markdown files to `docs/` following the existing directory structure
2. Update `sidebars.ts` if adding new pages
3. Run `npm run build` to verify there are no broken links
4. Submit a PR — the site auto-deploys when changes merge to `main`

## Adding a blog post

Posts live in `blog/`, one directory per post
(`blog/YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug/index.md`). Authors and tags are registries rather
than free-form front matter: the build fails on an author missing from
`blog/authors.yml`, a tag missing from `blog/tags.yml`, or a post with no
`{/* truncate */}` marker.

See [Writing a blog post](../CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-a-blog-post) for the full
process and style rules.


## Deploying on a fork

The `Docs site` workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) always builds the
site on pull requests and pushes to `main` so you get a build signal, but by
default it only **deploys** to GitHub Pages on the upstream repo
(`awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator`). On a fork, the `deploy` job is skipped —
this avoids the workflow failing with `Error: Failed to create deployment
... 404` (`actions/deploy-pages` errors because GitHub Pages isn't enabled on
most forks).

If you maintain a fork and want it to publish its own docs site, opt in
explicitly:

1. In your fork, go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub
   Actions**.
2. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** and add a
   repository variable named `DEPLOY_DOCS_PAGES` with the value `true`.
3. Push to `main` (or re-run the workflow). The `deploy` job will now run and
   publish to `https://<your-username>.github.io/cli-agent-orchestrator/`.

Without both of these steps, leave `DEPLOY_DOCS_PAGES` unset (or `false`) so
the deploy job stays disabled and the workflow doesn't fail on your fork.

## Interactive Courses

The two courses under `course-src/` are plain HTML assembled by
`course-src/build.sh` into `static/course/`, `static/course-advanced/`, and
`static/course-assets/`. That output is gitignored and rebuilt automatically by
the `prebuild` and `prestart` npm scripts, so edit the sources in `course-src/`
and never the assembled pages.

To rebuild them without a full site build:

```bash
npm run build-courses
```

## Brand Assets

`static/img/` holds the logo, and `cao-mark.svg` is the canonical geometry:

| File | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| `cao-mark.svg` | navbar in light mode |
| `cao-mark-dark.svg` | navbar in dark mode |
| `favicon.svg` | source for `favicon.ico` |
| `favicon.ico` | `favicon` in `docusaurus.config.ts`, and the web dashboard |
| `cao-social-card.svg` | source for the card below |
| `cao-social-card.png` | `themeConfig.image`, the GitHub repo social preview, and the banner at the top of both root READMEs |
| `cao-lockup.svg` | source for the light lockup PNG |
| `cao-lockup-dark.svg` | source for the dark lockup PNG |
| `cao-lockup.png` / `cao-lockup-dark.png` | the homepage hero heading in `src/pages/index.tsx`, swapped by `ThemedImage` |

Two variants exist because dark mode paints the navbar pure black (see the
navbar background override in `src/css/custom.css`) and the mark's navy
contrasts against that at roughly 2:1, under the 3:1 WCAG floor for graphical
objects. The dark file lifts navy to a light tint and changes nothing else.
`favicon.svg` is a third drawing: a solid hexagon with the graph knocked out in
white, because the outlined mark turns to mush at 16px and a favicon gets no
say in what background it lands on.

The card is committed as a PNG because neither GitHub's social preview nor
`og:image` consumers accept SVG. The root READMEs use it as their banner, where
it earns its keep by supplying its own background: the bare mark would need a
per-theme swap, and it cannot have one, because README.md doubles as the PyPI
long description and PyPI disallows `<picture>`.

That same constraint applies to the card. It is light, which matches PyPI, the
official artwork, and GitHub's light theme, and it shows as a bright panel on
GitHub's dark theme. It carries the name and tagline only, not the repo URL: as
a README banner the URL would sit on the page it points at, and in an unfurl the
link is already the thing being unfurled. Regenerate the card after editing the
source — the text baselines are measured against the mark's ink box, so re-check
the centering if you change the type sizes or the mark's transform:

```bash
cd static/img
rsvg-convert -w 1280 -h 640 cao-social-card.svg -o cao-social-card.png
```

`favicon.ico` is a three-size container (16/32/48) packed from `favicon.svg`,
which `rsvg-convert` alone cannot write. Rebuild it from the repository root
with:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_favicon.py
```

That script also writes `web/public/favicon.ico` and `web/public/favicon.svg`.
The web dashboard needs its own copies because Vite publishes only what is under
`web/public/` and Docusaurus only what is under `docusaurus/static/`, so neither
can point at the other's file. Run the script rather than editing either copy by
hand, so the two cannot drift.

The lockup pairs the mark with the two-line wordmark and is the only asset that
shows the logo in full. It ships as a PNG for the same reason the card does, but
for a sharper reason: the wordmark is live `<text>`, so an SVG on the page would
render in whatever font each *visitor* happens to have, and the logo would
differ per machine. Rasterizing at author time pins it.

### The brand typeface

The wordmark is **Inter Bold**, in both the lockup and the social card. Inter is
not a system font on any platform, so it has to be installed before you can
regenerate any asset containing text. Without it `rsvg-convert` silently falls
back to Arial and writes a file that looks wrong in a way no error reports.

Inter is under the SIL Open Font License. Install it system-wide, or scope it to
just the one command:

```bash
curl -sLo /tmp/inter.zip https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/download/v4.1/Inter-4.1.zip
mkdir -p /tmp/interfonts/fonts
unzip -jo /tmp/inter.zip 'extras/ttf/Inter-Bold.ttf' 'extras/ttf/Inter-Regular.ttf' \
  -d /tmp/interfonts/fonts
export XDG_DATA_HOME=/tmp/interfonts     # fontconfig reads $XDG_DATA_HOME/fonts
fc-match Inter:bold                      # must print Inter-Bold.ttf, not a fallback
```

Then regenerate both lockup variants together:

```bash
cd static/img
rsvg-convert -w 1800 -h 480 cao-lockup.svg -o cao-lockup.png
rsvg-convert -w 1800 -h 480 cao-lockup-dark.svg -o cao-lockup-dark.png
```

1800px wide covers the 600px display width at 3x. The viewBox is trimmed to the
artwork's ink box so the hero can center it without phantom margin.

The typeface is now correct, but the artwork around it is still a redraw from a
raster reference. The hexagon's interior graph and the exact brand hex values
are the parts to check against the official vector file, and the whole set
should be replaced by it rather than patched toward it.
