"""``TmuxClient.session_exists_strict`` against a REAL tmux server (#498).

This is the primitive the whole confirm-then-dismantle teardown rests on: it must
keep "the session is gone" apart from "the lookup failed", because
``delete_session`` deletes registry rows only once tmux is provably gone, and a
lookup error reaching it as False is exactly how rows get dropped from under a
live session.

Every test here runs a real ``tmux`` on a private socket, so the classification is
pinned against the tool's actual exit statuses and messages rather than against a
mock of the layer under test. That distinction is load-bearing: the bug this file
was written for was that the previous implementation went through libtmux's
``Server.sessions`` property, which wraps its ``list-sessions`` fetch in
``try/except Exception: pass``. Under a MagicMock that looks fine; against a real
socket failure it yields an EMPTY session list, so an unanswerable lookup reports
a clean absence and the check fails OPEN. No amount of mocking finds that — only
a real transport failure does.

Transient failures are injected AT THE TMUX BOUNDARY (pointing the client at a
socket path that cannot be spoken to, unlinking the socket, or killing the server
underneath it), never by stubbing ``session_exists_strict`` or the ``cmd`` call
itself.

One constraint the injection vectors have to respect: **tmux's stderr wording is
version-dependent.** Pointing tmux at a socket path that is a regular file yields
``Socket operation on non-socket`` (ENOTSOCK) on tmux 3.7b but ``no server running
on <path>`` (ECONNREFUSED) on tmux 3.2a — the earlier version's message reads as a
confirmed absence, so tests built on that vector are red on tmux < 3.3. The
messages tmux renders as ``error connecting to <path> (<strerror>)`` are worded by
the kernel's errno instead, so they are stable across versions; ``_unreachable``
below uses one of those (ENOTDIR), and it is also privilege-independent, unlike
the permission-denied vector.
