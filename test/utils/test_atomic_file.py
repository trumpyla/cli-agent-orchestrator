"""Tests for the shared locked-atomic-rewrite helper (caom-47e).

Covers the two defects reported against the memory plugins'
read-modify-write + "atomic" replace idiom:

* Defect A (shared temp filename): two concurrent unlocked writers using a
  FIXED temp path can interleave and one can unlink the other's live temp
  file, surfacing as FileNotFoundError on os.replace.
* Defect B (lost update): two concurrent writers doing read -> modify ->
  replace without a lock can both read the same base content; the second
  replace silently discards the first writer's change.

``locked_atomic_rewrite`` is exercised directly here (not through a
specific plugin) so the concurrency guarantees are pinned independently of
any one call site.
