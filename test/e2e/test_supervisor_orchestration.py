"""End-to-end supervisor orchestration tests for all providers.

Tests the REAL multi-agent flow where a supervisor agent uses MCP tools
(handoff, assign, send_message) to delegate work to sub-agents:

1. Launch supervisor with analysis_supervisor profile
2. Send a task requiring delegation
3. Verify supervisor calls handoff/assign (worker windows appear)
4. Verify supervisor produces a final combined response
5. Cleanup

This is distinct from test_handoff.py and test_assign.py which only test
individual worker agents receiving tasks directly via the API. Those tests
validate provider lifecycle (can receive input, produce output) but do NOT
test the MCP tool delegation flow.

Requires:
- Running CAO server
- Authenticated CLI tools
- Agent profiles installed: analysis_supervisor, data_analyst, report_generator
  (install with: cao install examples/assign/analysis_supervisor.md)

    """Wait for the supervisor to reach a stable ready state AND spawn workers.

    Some providers report a ready status after initial text output but before
    MCP tool calls (handoff/assign) finish creating worker terminals. A provider
    whose TUI keeps the idle prompt visible at all times can make the status
    detector see "response + idle prompt" = ready even while the model is
    between text output and the first MCP tool call.

    Similarly, Codex can briefly show ready between consecutive MCP tool calls
    (e.g., after assign returns but before handoff starts). Requiring
    ``stable_count`` consecutive ready readings avoids these false positives.

    "Done" means the supervisor has finished RENDERING its final output — not
    merely that it reached a ready status. kiro's IDLE is ambiguous (it is idle
    mid-dispatch, idle while awaiting a worker callback, and idle mid-repaint
    while presenting), so a status-only check races the presentation turn and
    reads a half-drawn TUI frame. The deterministic completion signal is OUTPUT
    QUIESCENCE: the ``mode=full`` buffer is byte-for-byte unchanged across
    ``stable_count`` consecutive polls. While the supervisor works, dispatches,
    or repaints (its spinner animates ~10 fps, text streams), the buffer keeps
    changing, so quiescence cannot hold mid-turn; once the report is fully
    rendered and the turn ends, it goes static. This removes the need to poll
    extraction with retries — by the time this returns, the output is complete.

    Because a genuine end-of-turn idle and an inter-turn idle can both be briefly
    quiescent, orchestration flows add a structural completion guard:
    - ``require_inbox_callback`` (async assign): a DELIVERED callback exists and
      nothing is still PENDING — the supervisor has received every worker result.
    - ``require_worker_completed`` (sync handoff): a seen worker has left the
      session (handoff auto-deletes its worker on completion).

    The ``handoff`` MCP tool auto-deletes its worker terminal as soon as the
    worker finishes. A point-in-time session listing taken after the supervisor
    reports ready can therefore miss workers that came and went during the run.
    To avoid this race we accumulate the union of every unique terminal id
    observed across all polls — once seen, a worker "counts" even if it has
    since been cleaned up.

    This function polls until ALL of these are true:
    - Terminal status is ready (idle/completed)
    - The output buffer is unchanged for ``stable_count`` consecutive polls
    - At least min_terminals unique terminals have been observed in the session
    - If ``require_inbox_callback``: a delivered callback exists, none pending
    - If ``require_worker_completed``: a seen worker has left the live session

    Returns (last_status, terminals_list) where terminals_list is the union
    of all unique terminals seen during polling.
