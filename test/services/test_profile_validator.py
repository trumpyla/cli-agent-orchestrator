"""Tests for profile frontmatter validation as a shared service.

Covers the structured contract that both ``cao profile validate`` and
``POST /agents/profiles/validate`` sit on top of. The CLI's rendered
``[error]`` / ``[warn]`` string form is covered separately in
``test/cli/test_profile_cmd.py``, which is deliberately left unchanged so it
also serves as the no-behaviour-change guard for the extraction.
