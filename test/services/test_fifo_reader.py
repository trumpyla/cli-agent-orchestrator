    review had already touched.

    True interpreter-level race conditions (a context switch landing in the
    exact unlucky spot) can't be forced deterministically in a unit test the
    way the round-2 ``test_stop_during_probe_does_not_resurrect_state`` could
    (that one worked because the injected ``probe()`` callback gave us a hook
    to run the "concurrent" mutation synchronously, in-line, at the precise
    moment). Neither gap here has an equivalent injection point, so these
    tests use real threads and a synchronization barrier (for the first) and
    a real-thread churn stress test (for the second) to raise confidence
    rather than guarantee a repro on every run.

        self._last_data_at[terminal_id] = time.monotonic()`` must check and

        are not atomic, a ``stop_reader()`` that pops both dicts between them
        resurrects ``_last_data_at[terminal_id]`` after teardown — a slow leak
        across create/stop churn that ``_watchdog_loop`` (which only iterates
        ``_pane_probe``) will never revisit or clean up.

        This forces the exact interleaving via a synchronization barrier
        (blocking ``time.monotonic()`` while the reader thread holds the lock
        for the write) instead of relying on timing luck, and additionally
        asserts that ``stop_reader()`` is provably blocked on the held lock
        during that window — a mechanical proof the two sections share a
