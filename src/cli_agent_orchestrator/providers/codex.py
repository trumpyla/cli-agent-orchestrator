# THE TITLE IS NOT THE HOOK. An earlier revision of this detector required one of
# three enumerated question titles inside a fixed-height bottom window, and both
# halves of that were wrong:
#
#   * The enumeration is incomplete, and cannot be completed. `strings` over the
#     0.147.0 native binary turns up at least two more approval titles driving the
#     same menu -- `Do you want to approve network access to "<host>"?` (emitted
#     when features.network_proxy is on, with its own `Yes, and allow this host in
#     ...` / `No, and block this host in the future` options) and `Approve app tool
#     call?` -- so any title list is a list of the variants someone happened to
#     have already seen.
#   * The fixed window fails OPEN. The command preview between the title and the
#     menu is the verbatim command, untruncated by the renderer, so a multi-line
#     heredoc pushes the title out of any fixed row budget; the detector then found
#     no title and returned IDLE for a hard-blocked pane, which is the dangerous
#     direction to be wrong in.
#
# So detection is structural and bottom-up instead -- see
# :func:`_has_approval_prompt_in_bottom`. These title patterns survive only as the
# permissive NEGATIVE gate in STARTUP_BLOCKING_INPUT_PATTERN below, where an extra
# match merely keeps the startup poll going and is therefore free; the network
# title is folded in there for the same reason. Nothing positive is classified off
# a title any more.

# The footer under a blocking list menu is OPTIONAL CORROBORATION, not an
# anchor: both list actions are unbindable (`tui.keymap.list.accept = []` --
# an empty list explicitly unbinds; config/src/tui_keymap.rs at rust-v0.147.0),
# and accept_cancel_hint_line (tui/src/bottom_pane/popup_consts.rs) renders one
# of FOUR shapes accordingly:
#   both bound     -> "Press <a> to confirm or <c> to cancel"
#   accept unbound -> "Press <c> to cancel"
#   cancel unbound -> "Press <a> to confirm"
#   both unbound   -> no footer line at all
# The approval overlay may append " or <k> to open thread"
# (approval_overlay.rs), which is also the WHOLE line when both list actions
# are unbound, and the generic popups (model picker) say "to go back" where
# the approval says "to cancel". So this pattern's job is only to recognise a
# footer line as part of the menu block wherever one is rendered.
#
# The key labels are emitted as separately styled spans -- the sentence is not
# one literal in the binary -- and a label is NOT a single token: a two-stroke
# chord such as "ctrl-x ctrl-s" renders via ShortcutHint::display_label() as
# `ctrl + x ctrl + s` (strokes joined by a space, modifiers by " + ";
# key_hint.rs). Worst legal label is a chord whose strokes each carry
# ctrl+shift+alt: 7 tokens per stroke, 14 in total, so a label is matched as
# 1-15 whitespace-separated tokens. The bound keeps a same-line prose sentence
# from bridging an unrelated "Press" to a distant "to confirm".

    APPROVAL_MODAL_HEADER_PATTERN's comment and
    :func:`_has_approval_prompt_in_bottom` for the copy that is live today.

    Anchored BOTTOM-UP on the last choice line, because the thing being tested
    is an invariant about the bottom of the pane, not about a region of it: a
    live modal blocks the TUI, so it must BE the bottom, with only frame rows
    and footer chrome after it. Four guards:

    1. **Anchor.** The LAST line that reduces to a choice key. Taking the last
       rather than the first is what lets an already-answered modal sitting in
       scrollback above a live one be ignored instead of vetoing it.
    2. **Nothing but chrome below the anchor.** See :func:`_is_chrome_only`.
       This subsumes the older spinner test (a spinner is not chrome) and also
       rejects a modal transcript the model quoted mid-reply, since the reply
       continues below the quote. It replaces "footer must NOT appear below",
       which would have false-negatived every real modal: with
       ``--no-alt-screen`` the footer renders at the bottom regardless.
    3. **Corroborating header above the anchor,** found by walking up and
       stopping at the first :func:`_is_transcript_marker` — the box is one
       transcript cell, so the header must be inside it. No fixed window, so an
       arbitrarily tall modal still resolves; previously a >15-line modal lost
       its header and failed open to COMPLETED.
    4. **Line structure and left-margin position.** Each half must own its line
       (header an exact match, choice line a prefix match) and sit at the box's
       margin rather than under a prose indent — see :func:`_modal_line_content`.

    Known residual: a framed modal quote that ENDS a reply, with only the empty
    composer and footer after it, satisfies all four guards and reads as live.
    Distinguishing it needs semantics this detector does not have; it costs a
    spurious WAITING_USER_ANSWER (work withheld) rather than a COMPLETED (work
    pasted into a blocked pane), which is the safe direction to be wrong in.

def _has_approval_prompt_in_bottom(clean_output: str) -> bool:
    """Return True when Codex's runtime approval prompt is active at the bottom.

    This is the prompt codex-cli 0.147.0 actually renders (verified against three
    live captures). Detection is STRUCTURAL and bottom-up — the numbered menu
    itself, not the question title and not the footer — because none of the
    alternatives can be relied on: the title list cannot be completed, a fixed
    row budget fails open on a long command preview (see
    APPROVAL_PROMPT_PATTERN), and the footer is absent entirely when the list
    actions are unbound (`tui.keymap.list.accept = []` renders the same blocking
    menu with only "Press esc to cancel", or with no footer line at all — see
    APPROVAL_PROMPT_FOOTER).

    Three guards, in the order they are cheapest to refute:

    1. **Menu-cursor anchor.** The LAST line whose selection cursor sits flush
       at column 0 (APPROVAL_MENU_CURSOR_PATTERN). Taking the last, not the
       first, lets an already-answered prompt in scrollback be ignored rather
       than shadow a live one below it. Column 0 is where Codex draws every
       transcript gutter marker, so quoted or continuation prose — a menu the
       model merely PASTED into a reply — carries its cursor at column >= 2 and
       fails this.
    2. **Nothing below the anchor but the rest of the menu block**: the
       remaining (non-cursor) option rows — each an option-start row plus any
       wrapped continuation rows at the option text column
       (APPROVAL_MENU_CONTINUATION_PATTERN; the renderer wraps long options by
       default, so a narrow pane splits one option across lines) — at most one
       footer hint in any of its rendered forms, and chrome
       (:func:`_is_chrome_only`, shared with the boxed-modal detector).
       Continuations are honoured only while inside an option; indented prose
       after the footer or after blank filler still disqualifies. A live
       prompt blocks the TUI, so its menu must BE the bottom of the pane. This
       is the guard that rejects an ordinary COMPLETED reply which quotes the
       menu while a live composer and more prose sit underneath — the sticky
       WAITING_USER_ANSWER that case used to latch would wedge a ready worker.
    3. **Menu size.** At least APPROVAL_MENU_MIN_OPTIONS option-START rows
       counted contiguously around the anchor, stepping over wrapped
       continuation rows (a genuine approval always offers accept and
       decline). Contiguity matters: counting across the question or the
       command preview would let a numbered list INSIDE a quoted command
       inflate the tally.

    Deliberately NOT required: any particular question title, any particular
    option copy, and the footer. The footer, when present in any of its four
    rendered shapes, is accepted as part of the block; its absence proves
    nothing because unbinding the accept action removes it while the menu still
    blocks. Firing on Codex's other blocking numbered menus (the model picker,
    for one) is correct rather than tolerated — those panes are equally blocked
    on a keystroke, and WAITING_USER_ANSWER is the right answer for them too.

    Residual risks, disclosed:

    - The column-0 cursor test is what separates a live menu from one pasted
      into a reply, so a future renderer that indents the cursor would fail
      open to IDLE. The live captures in test/providers/fixtures/
      (codex_approval_{modal,edits,long_preview}_raw.txt) pin the current
      rendering against that.
    - A USER message that is itself a numbered list ("1. foo\\n2. bar") renders
      with the same column-0 gutter marker ("› 1. foo" over "  2. bar"), so if
      it is the last transcript cell with only the idle composer below — codex
      interrupted before replying, say — it now reads WAITING rather than IDLE.
      That errs toward withholding work, never toward pasting into a blocked
      pane, and clears as soon as codex renders any activity below the cell.
      The footer-anchored version rejected this shape, but only by failing open
      to IDLE on every unbound-keymap approval, which is the dangerous
      direction to be wrong in.

                # (MAX_CANON, 4096 bytes on Linux) is silently truncated/dropped by the kernel's
                # tty line discipline before the shell ever sees a complete, valid command --
                # this manifests as the shell hanging at an unclosed-quote continuation prompt
                # forever (confirmed live: zero codex process ever spawned under the pane's shell,

                # fires with a generic "Codex initialization timed out" that gives no hint of the
                # real cause. $(cat <file>) is expanded internally by the shell BEFORE exec'ing

                # limit at all, only the typed/pasted command line is. Wrapped in double quotes
                # (not left bare, not single-quoted) so the substitution still happens (command
                # substitution is disabled inside single quotes) while word-splitting/globbing of
                # the substituted content is suppressed (it is not inside single quotes either).
                # The file's own content is `_toml_scalar`'s output verbatim, already including

                # otherwise single-quote the whole "developer_instructions=$(cat ...)" fragment as

                # Same underlying instructions/skills length problem does not affect Claude Code

                # --append-system-prompt-file, kimi_cli.py's system_prompt_path: YAML field).
