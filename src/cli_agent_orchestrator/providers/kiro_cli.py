"""Kiro CLI provider implementation.

This module provides the KiroCliProvider class for integrating with Kiro CLI,
an AI-powered coding assistant that operates through a terminal interface.

Kiro CLI Features:
- Agent-based conversations with customizable profiles
- File system access and code manipulation capabilities
- Interactive permission prompts for sensitive operations
- ANSI-colored output with distinctive prompt patterns

The provider detects the following terminal states:
- IDLE: Agent is waiting for user input (shows agent prompt)
- PROCESSING: Agent is generating a response
- COMPLETED: Agent has finished responding (shows green arrow + response)
- WAITING_USER_ANSWER: Agent is waiting for permission confirmation
- ERROR: Agent encountered an error during processing

# Regex Patterns for Kiro CLI Output Analysis
# =============================================================================

# Green arrow pattern indicates the start of an agent response (escape-stripped)
# Example: "> Here is the code you requested..."
GREEN_ARROW_PATTERN = r"^>\s*"

# SGR (colour) escape codes only. Used by get_status, which strips colour but
# MUST preserve carriage returns and cursor-movement sequences: the permission
# detection counts idle prompts per newline-delimited line, and Kiro renders
# active prompts with \r in-place redraws (same line, no \n). strip_terminal_
# escapes would normalise \r -> \n and split those redraws onto separate lines,
# making an active permission prompt look idle (inbox would then deliver during
# a permission prompt — see test_permission_prompt_detection).
ANSI_CODE_PATTERN = r"\x1b\[[0-9;]*m"

# Additional escape sequences that may appear in terminal output
ESCAPE_SEQUENCE_PATTERN = r"\[[?0-9;]*[a-zA-Z]"

# Control characters to strip from final output
CONTROL_CHAR_PATTERN = r"[\x00-\x1f\x7f-\x9f]"

# Legacy-UI IDLE prompt pattern for log files (with ANSI codes)
IDLE_PROMPT_PATTERN_LOG = r"\x1b\[38;5;\d+m\[.+?\].*\x1b\[38;5;\d+m>\s*\x1b\[\d*m"

# =============================================================================
# New TUI Patterns (Kiro CLI without --legacy-ui)
# =============================================================================

# New TUI idle prompt: "Ask a question or describe a task ↵"
# Case-insensitive match; comma between "question" and "or" is optional
# (older versions used lowercase with comma, v1.29+ uses capitalized without)
NEW_TUI_IDLE_PATTERN = r"[Aa]sk a question,? or describe a task"

# New TUI IDLE prompt pattern for log files (with ANSI codes)
NEW_TUI_IDLE_PATTERN_LOG = r"[Aa]sk a question,? or describe a task"

# TUI separator line: horizontal bar (────) used to delimit sections.
# Require 20+ chars to avoid matching short markdown separators in agent output.
TUI_SEPARATOR_PATTERN = r"^[─]{20,}$"

# Non-SGR CSI sequences (erase-line \x1b[2K, cursor moves, etc.) — everything
# except colour codes ending in 'm'. Compiled once at module scope because
# get_status() is on a hot path (called per output burst); recompiling per call
# was avoidable overhead. Used in Check 6 to strip TUI chrome so the separator
# regex can anchor on the raw ─── characters.
_NON_SGR_CSI = re.compile(r"\x1b\[[0-9;?]*[^m]")

# TUI Credits line: "▸ Credits: N.NN • Time: Ns" marks response completion
TUI_CREDITS_PATTERN = r"▸\s*Credits:\s*[\d.]+"

# TUI processing indicator: ghost text shown while agent is working.
# kiro-cli 2.11+ replaced "Kiro is working" with "Thinking..." (with an
# optional "(esc to cancel)" suffix). Match either variant.
TUI_PROCESSING_PATTERN = r"Kiro is working|Thinking\.\.\."

# TUI initialization indicator: shown during startup before chat is ready.
# Kiro TUI renders the idle prompt placeholder ("Ask a question or describe
# a task") *before* the "● Initializing..." phase completes, which caused a
# premature IDLE verdict. "Initializing..." is cleared by Kiro once startup
# finishes, so its presence unconditionally means PROCESSING (unlike the
# "Kiro is working" ghost text, which can linger as stale after a redraw).
#
# Also covers the MCP-server boot line "M of N mcp servers initialized.
# ctrl-c to start chatting now" — Kiro shows this *before* the idle prompt
# is interactive, so a paste sent during this window is absorbed by the
# pre-prompt boot screen and silently dropped (observed during e2e
# allowed-tools tests).
#
# kiro-cli 2.8.x also shows "Initializing · type to queue a message" during
# boot (different from the "Initializing..." with three dots).
TUI_INITIALIZING_PATTERN = (
    r"Initializing\.\.\."
    r"|\d+ of \d+ mcp servers initialized\.\s*ctrl-c to start chatting now"
    r"|Initializing\s*·\s*type to queue a message"
)


# TUI permission prompt: shown instead of legacy [y/n/t] format.
# Requires all three options together to avoid false positives on "Yes"/"No" in agent output.
# Kiro 2.11 renders the same three-way choice with different wording for
# subagent spawning: "Yes, single permission / Trust, always allow in this
# session / No (Tab to edit)". Both alternatives anchor on the full Yes/Trust/No
# option layout so agent output that merely mentions a permission prompt (or
# quotes "subagent requires approval") can't flip status to WAITING_USER_ANSWER
# — the bare header alternative was dropped for that reason. In practice
# --trust-all-tools suppresses this prompt anyway; detection is a safety net.
TUI_PERMISSION_PATTERN = (
    r"Yes\s+No\s+Always [Aa]llow"
    r"|Yes,\s*single permission[\s\S]{0,200}?Trust,\s*always allow[\s\S]{0,200}?No"
)

# TUI trust-all-tools acceptance dialog: shown at startup when --trust-all-tools is passed.
# Matches the footer navigation chrome to avoid false positives on warning text in agent output.
# Must be anchored to bottom screen region (see get_status WAITING check) to avoid stale matches.
TUI_TRUST_ALL_TOOLS_FOOTER = r"esc to cancel · ↑↓ to navigate · ↵ to select"

# Distinctive consent-dialog body text. TUI_TRUST_ALL_TOOLS_FOOTER above is
# kiro's GENERIC list-selector chrome — an update/login/onboarding selector
# renders it identically — so before answering we require this trust-specific
# line, and require the ❯ cursor to sit on "No, exit" so Down lands on
