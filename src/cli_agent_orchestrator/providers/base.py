"""Base provider interface for CLI tool abstraction.

This module defines the abstract base class that all CLI providers must implement.
A "provider" is an adapter that enables CAO to interact with a specific CLI-based
AI agent (e.g., Kiro CLI, Claude Code, Codex).

Provider Responsibilities:
- Initialize the CLI tool in a tmux window (run startup commands)
- Detect terminal state by parsing terminal output (IDLE, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, etc.)
- Extract agent responses from terminal output
- Provide cleanup logic when terminal is deleted

Implemented Providers:
- KiroCliProvider: For Kiro CLI (kiro-cli chat)
- ClaudeCodeProvider: For Claude Code (claude)
- CodexProvider: For Codex CLI (codex)

Each provider must implement pattern matching for its specific CLI's prompt
and output format to reliably detect status changes.

        Event-inbox backends (herdr) never populate the pushed StatusMonitor
        buffer -- ``pipe_pane`` is a no-op there (see ``_resolve_native_status``)
        -- so an empty ``buffer`` on herdr does not mean the pane has no
        content, only that the push pipeline was never fed. Falling straight
        through to a provider's "no output" default (UNKNOWN, or ERROR for
        hermes) on every herdr call was the original #359 gap; guessing status
        from dispatch timing (the #400 native-None matrix this replaces) traded
        that gap for silently masking real failures behind an optimistic
        window. Reading the backend's live pane content instead lets each
        provider's EXISTING pattern matching (idle prompt, error text, response
        markers) run against real content: a dead launch's error text is
        visible, a wedged pane genuinely shows no prompt, and a finished turn's
        response is genuinely there to extract.
