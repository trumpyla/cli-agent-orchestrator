"""Antigravity CLI (``agy``) provider implementation.

Antigravity CLI (https://antigravity.google) is Google's terminal-native AI
coding agent — the successor to the Gemini CLI after Google retired the free
Gemini Code Assist "Login with Google" path for the ``gemini`` binary on
2026-06-18. The CLI is invoked via the ``agy`` binary
(``curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash``).

Key characteristics (observed on ``agy`` 1.0.10, full-screen TUI):

- Command: ``agy`` with ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` to auto-approve tool
  calls so orchestrated (handoff / assign) flows do not block on per-tool
  approval prompts, ``--model "<name>"`` to pick a model (human-readable
  strings such as ``"Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)"`` — see ``agy models``), and
  ``-i "<prompt>"`` (``--prompt-interactive``) to inject the agent profile's
  system prompt as the first message and then continue interactively.
- Idle prompt: a ``>`` input box delimited by full-width ``─`` (U+2500) rule
  lines, with the footer hint ``? for shortcuts`` and the model name in the
  status bar.
- Processing: the footer flips to ``esc to cancel`` and a braille spinner line
  (``⣯ Generating...`` / ``⣽ Working...`` — the word varies) appears. The
  footer marker is the reliable, render-stable signal (it survives
  ``strip_terminal_escapes``); the spinner word is not.
- Completed: the response is rendered (2-space indented) between the echoed
  ``> <query>`` line and the input box, and the footer returns to
  ``? for shortcuts``.
- MCP config: written to ``~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`` under the
  top-level ``mcpServers`` key (``agy`` reads MCP servers from this fixed
  path; there is no per-invocation override flag).
- System prompt / role: ``agy`` honors a guarded ``-i`` instruction (verified:
  it adopts the role and waits without exploring when told to). The profile
  body, skill catalog, and (when tool-restricted) the security prompt are
  injected this way.
- Exit: ``/quit`` (slash command) — also exits on Ctrl-D pressed twice.

Status detection mirrors the structural, footer-anchored approach used by the
Cursor CLI provider: the presence of ``esc to cancel`` means PROCESSING; the
presence of ``? for shortcuts`` means IDLE / COMPLETED (split on a turn
counter, since the TUI looks identical in both states).

        Mirrors ClaudeCodeProvider._handle_startup_prompts (once PR #451

        answers, in whatever order they appear:
        - workspace-trust picker → Enter (accepts the pre-selected "Yes")
        - feedback survey → "0" + Enter (Skip)
        Both can appear in ONE startup (trust first, survey after), so a
        dismissal continues the loop rather than returning. Exits once agy is
        at its ready footer with no dialog on screen — the survey renders ON
        TOP of the footer, so the survey check must run before the idle exit.

        issue #494: this is a real coroutine, not sync code called from an
        async caller. This method is awaited directly from initialize(), which
        runs on cao-server's single asyncio event loop. Every tmux-backed call
        here (``get_history``/``send_special_key``/``send_keys``) is a
        blocking subprocess exec, and a plain ``time.sleep`` would block the
        WHOLE OS thread -- freezing every other in-flight request -- for as
        long as this loop runs. All blocking calls are offloaded to a worker
        thread via ``asyncio.to_thread`` and all sleeps are ``asyncio.sleep``,
        so this coroutine yields the event loop instead of freezing it (see PR
        #451 for the ClaudeCodeProvider fix this mirrors).

        Idle-gap semantics (see issue #400): a cold or containerized start can
        render these dialogs LATE and in sequence, past the old fixed ~20s
        window. Rather than a total-window budget, ``idle_gap`` is the maximum
        quiet stretch tolerated BETWEEN prompts: answering a dialog resets the
        idle timer, and the loop exits once no new prompt appears for
        ``idle_gap`` seconds (or agy reaches its ready footer). Total runtime is
        hard-capped by ``outer_timeout``.

        The idle-gap exit only starts counting once the first dialog has been
        handled -- until then, a first dialog arriving later than ``idle_gap``
        (the scenario issue #400 itself reports) would otherwise be missed: the
        loop would exit at the idle-gap boundary having never seen it. Before
        any dialog is observed, only ``outer_timeout`` can end the loop.

        Args:
            idle_gap: Seconds of no-new-prompt quiet that ends the loop. Defaults
                to the ``startup_prompt_handler_timeout`` setting.
            outer_timeout: Hard cap (seconds) on total handler runtime. Defaults
                to the ``provider_init_timeout`` setting; initialize() passes the
                per-profile-resolved value so a containerized profile's longer
                init budget also governs this handler (mirrors ClaudeCodeProvider).
