# *segments* (``key``, ``scope``, ``scope_id``) under a fixed base
# directory. The safe primitive there is strict per-segment validation plus
# realpath containment under the base, so the two helpers below are kept
# distinct from the absolute-path validator.

# A single safe path segment: strict allowlist, no separators, no traversal.
