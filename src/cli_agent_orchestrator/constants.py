# StatusMonitor buffer, and GET /terminals/{id}/output all stall on stale
# content indefinitely (pane_pipe still reports 1; nothing errors). The
# FifoManager watchdog compares tmux's live pane content against whether the
# FIFO delivered any bytes in the same window: pane advanced + FIFO silent =
# a stalled forwarder, which it re-arms (stop_pipe_pane then pipe_pane — a bare

# shell renders its prompt once and then sits idle (the common case), every
# check sees the identical content as the last, "diverged_from_baseline" is
# always False, and the watchdog can wait forever without ever re-arming —
# meanwhile wait_for_shell() times out (60s default) waiting for a FIFO
# buffer that was never going to fill. This is a separate, positive check:
# has the FIFO delivered ANYTHING at all since the terminal was registered?
# If not, and this much time has passed, and the live pane already has real
# content (ruling out "still genuinely booting, nothing to show yet"), the
# forwarder never started forwarding in the first place — re-arm immediately
# rather than waiting on a divergence that will never arrive. Deliberately

# one-time attach timing gap) would re-trigger the cold-start check every grace
# period forever: a successful rearm() doesn't mark the FIFO as having
# delivered — only the reader thread pulling a real byte off it does — so
# "still False after grace period" stays true and the same terminal gets
# re-armed and replayed indefinitely, an unbounded stop/start + replay loop.

# session/server had died was re-probed every PIPE_LIVENESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_S forever, each
# tick emitting a full-traceback ERROR — an unbounded, self-amplifying log/CPU storm across
# every ghost terminal exactly when the box is already unhealthy (live incident: ~578k
# error lines, a strong contributor to a near-simultaneous mass session teardown). After
# this many consecutive probe failures, give up loudly ONCE and drop the terminal from the
# watchdog, exactly like the rearm-exception and cold-start paths already do. The counter

# at least as large as any attached terminal, or the bottom-anchored input box
# (────/❯/────) renders BELOW the composite and get_status_from_screen never
# sees the idle/ready prompt → init/turn detection times out (observed live with

    that is exactly the shape an HTTPS-terminating proxy produces when its
    address is not in ``TRUSTED_FORWARDER_IPS``: uvicorn then ignores
    ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` and reports ``scheme="http"`` for a request the browser
    genuinely made over TLS. Rejecting that direction would break working
    reverse-proxy and Codespaces deployments without closing a real hole, since
    forging it means already controlling the victim's own origin over TLS.

    That leniency has a corollary worth stating: the comparison only does
    anything where ``scheme`` is trustworthy, meaning uvicorn terminates TLS
    itself or the proxy is listed in ``TRUSTED_FORWARDER_IPS``. Behind an
    untrusted proxy ``scheme`` is ``"http"`` on a request the browser made over
    TLS, and the check is then inert in both directions: the ``http`` Origin is
    accepted as well. Operators who want it enforced should set
    ``CAO_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`` to the proxy address.

    ``scheme=None`` skips the comparison entirely, preserving the behaviour
    callers had before the scheme was threaded through.

    """Whether a WebSocket handshake ``Origin`` header may open a PTY socket.

    Rules, tightest-safe first:

    * A missing / empty ``Origin`` is allowed. Browsers *always* send it on a
      cross-site WebSocket handshake, so its absence means the caller is a
      non-browser client (native ``websockets`` lib, CLI, tests). Those are
      still gated by the loopback IP allowlist (``WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS``); the
      cross-site-request-forgery threat this guards against is browser-only.
    * A literal ``*`` in ``WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` disables the check (opt-in
      escape hatch for trusted tunnels, matching ``WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS``).
    * **Same-origin**: the ``Origin`` authority equals the request ``Host``.
      This is the request the browser makes when the viewer is served by
      cao-server itself, and it is exactly what a cross-site attacker CANNOT
      forge — script-set ``Host`` is forbidden and the real ``Host`` is the
      CAO server the socket is opened to, not the attacker's page. Matching on
      the live ``Host`` is what lets the imported-app deployment
      (``uvicorn ...:app``, which never runs ``add_local_cors_origins``) and
      dynamic reverse-proxy / Codespaces hostnames work without pre-registering
      every origin.

      This branch trusts ``Host`` and so is only as safe as ``Host`` itself:
      ``TrustedHostMiddleware`` validates ``Host`` against ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` on
      the same WebSocket scope BEFORE this handler runs, which is what makes
      the match DNS-rebinding-safe in the default (loopback) config. Setting
      ``CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS="*"`` turns that validation off (``allow_any``), so an
      operator who does that has opted out of the DNS-rebinding protection for
      this branch too — the same explicit-opt-out tradeoff as
      ``CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS="*"``. Keep ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` scoped to the real
      serving hostname(s) rather than ``*`` whenever possible.

      When ``scheme`` is supplied (the ASGI ``scope["scheme"]``, i.e. ``ws`` or
      ``wss``), the match also requires the schemes to agree. See
      ``_is_same_origin``.
    * Otherwise the ``Origin`` must appear in the explicit allowlists: the same
      ``CORS_ORIGINS`` list the HTTP API enforces plus any
      ``CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` entries. Exact-string match mirrors how the
      browser reports ``Origin`` and how ``CORSMiddleware`` compares it.

    A ``*`` entry in ``CORS_ORIGINS`` (i.e. ``CAO_CORS_ORIGINS="*"``) is
    **deliberately NOT** treated as a wildcard here: it would open unauthenticated
    PTY access — keystroke injection is RCE — to every website the victim
    visits, a far higher blast radius than the read-oriented HTTP surface
    ``CORSMiddleware`` guards. Disabling this check therefore requires the
    dedicated, more conspicuous ``CAO_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*"`` opt-in, matching
    the ``CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS="*"`` escape hatch for the IP check. This
    divergence from ``CORSMiddleware`` is intentional.

      When ``scheme`` is supplied (the ASGI ``scope["scheme"]``), the match also
      requires the schemes to agree, so an ``https`` request no longer accepts a
      plain-``http`` Origin as same-origin. See ``_is_same_origin`` for why the
      comparison is one-directional.
    * Otherwise the ``Origin`` must be in ``CORS_ORIGINS``. Exact-string match
      mirrors how the browser serializes ``Origin`` and how ``CORSMiddleware``
      compares it, so anything the CORS layer already trusts for reads is

# =============================================================================
# ``group`` and (especially) ``metadata`` are written by the terminal's own
# running agent via the ``update_metadata``/``update_group`` MCP tools, with
# no operator review in the loop. Left unbounded, a worker could grow the
# terminals.metadata/group TEXT columns arbitrarily, and that growth is
# amplified into every sibling's ``list_siblings`` response (call-me-ram, PR
# #433 review). Same shape as ``WORKFLOW_MAX_SPEC_BYTES``: a structural cap
# enforced at the request boundary, fail-closed with 422.
