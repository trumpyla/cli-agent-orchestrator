    """A tmux listing could not be read, so the answer is UNKNOWN — not "absent".

    libtmux >= 0.53.1 parses ``list-sessions`` / ``list-windows`` / ``list-panes``
    output with ``dict(zip(formats, values, strict=True))`` (``libtmux/neo.py``,
    ``parse_output``) against a fixed 125-name format list, stripping only ONE
    trailing empty field. Any row that yields fewer than 125 values — a
    session/window/pane that disappears mid-listing, or a trailing field this
    tmux build simply omits — raises ``ValueError('zip() argument 2 is shorter
    than argument 1')`` instead of degrading. Under load (many concurrent CAO
    sessions polling the same tmux server) that race fires constantly.

    This exception exists so the failure cannot masquerade as a missing session.
    Everything else in this module signals a *genuine* absence with a plain
    ``ValueError`` (or ``None`` / ``False`` / ``[]`` for the query-style
    methods), so a caller that needs to tell "the session is really gone" from
    "we could not look" catches ``TmuxLookupError`` explicitly. It is
    deliberately NOT a subclass of ``ValueError``: an ``except ValueError``
    written for the not-found case must not swallow it.

    ``session_exists_strict`` raises it for a SECOND, unrelated cause: a
    ``list-sessions`` that tmux itself could not answer (an unreachable socket
    whose server may still be alive, a permission error, an unrecognised
    failure). Both causes mean the same thing to a caller — the answer is
    UNKNOWN — which is why they share one type. Session teardown turns it into a
    failed, re-runnable teardown with the registry left intact (#498), the
    fail-CLOSED direction.

    Treat it as transient and retryable — ``TmuxClient`` already retries the
    read once before raising.

# but "no server running on <path>" (ECONNREFUSED) on tmux 3.2a. So do not grow
# these tables from one version's observed output, and do not write tests around

    2. **The process table** (``ps``), only if no socket-table detector could

       tmux process anywhere, ALIVE when some tmux process names this exact path,

            force_bracketed_paste: If True, guarantee bracketed-paste framing
                for message delivery to TUIs -- UNLESS the pane's live
                foreground command (per #{pane_current_command}) is a known
                shell (see BRACKETED_PASTE_INCOMPATIBLE_SHELLS), in which
                case the wrap is skipped entirely and the content is
                delivered as plain keystrokes instead. A bare shell doesn't
                understand the escape sequences and glues them onto the
                first token of the command, corrupting it -- the caller
                asking for bracketed delivery does not always know the
                target TUI has already exited (e.g. via its own `/exit`)
                and left the pane at a shell prompt, so this is checked
                fresh on every call rather than trusted from the caller's
                own intent.

                For a pane that IS running a real TUI, how the wrap is
                applied depends on the tmux version: on tmux < 3.7 this
                wraps the buffer in hand-crafted \x1b[200~...\x1b[201~
                markers and pastes with -r (no LF->CR conversion) —
                required because paste-buffer -p only emits markers when
                the pane enabled DECSET 2004, and some TUIs (e.g. kiro-cli)
                never do, so under -p their multi-line messages would
                submit per-line (#230). On tmux >= 3.7 the hand-crafted wrap
                is impossible: pasted buffer content passes through vis(3)
                sanitization (hardening against bracket-end injection),
                turning each raw ESC into the literal two characters "^["
                — hand-crafted markers render as visible "^[[200~" garbage
                in the receiving TUI (issue #413). There we paste raw
                content with -p, which emits genuine 0x1b markers
                conditionally on the pane's DECSET 2004 state; non-2004
                panes receive raw text and multi-line content submits
                per-line (tmux-sanctioned paste semantics — nothing better
                exists on >= 3.7 without -S, which is deliberately NOT used
                because it bypasses the vis(3) hardening and would let
                worker-authored message bytes smuggle control sequences
                into a receiving TUI). Do NOT set for shell commands sent
                to bash during initialization (bash 4.x would receive the
                literal escape sequences on tmux < 3.7).

        Unlike ``session_exists``, this never collapses a query error into
        "absent": a live session returns True, a confirmed absence returns False,
        and an inability to tell raises ``TmuxLookupError`` — the only exception
        type this method lets out. Teardown depends on that third case existing —
        it deletes registry rows only once tmux is provably gone, so "couldn't
        tell" reaching it as False is precisely how rows get dropped from under a
        live session (#498).

        Why this does NOT go through ``self.server.sessions``: libtmux's
        ``Server.sessions`` property wraps its ``list-sessions`` fetch in a bare
        ``try/except Exception: pass`` and returns whatever it collected. A
        transient socket or tmux failure therefore yields an EMPTY QueryList,
        indistinguishable from a server with no sessions, and the lookup on it
        reports a clean absence. Any strict check built on that property fails
        OPEN by construction, no matter how its own exceptions are handled. So we
        issue the query ourselves through ``Server.cmd`` (which runs the tmux
        subprocess and exposes ``returncode``/``stderr`` without swallowing
        anything) and classify the outcome.

        **False is only ever returned on positive evidence of absence:**

        * exit 0 and the name is not in the list — the list is authoritative;
          membership is an exact string match against ``#{session_name}``, with no
          tmux target-syntax parsing involved, so no prefix or ``=``/``:`` quoting
          subtleties. Matches the old ``sessions.get(session_name=...)``.
        * the kernel refused the connection to the socket path (ECONNREFUSED,
          ``_NO_SERVER_STDERR_MARKERS``) — the path resolved and nothing is
          listening, so there is no server and therefore no session.
        * the socket path does NOT exist (ENOENT, ``_SOCKET_MISSING_STDERR_MARKERS``)
          **and** ``_tmux_server_liveness`` finds no tmux server bound to it. The
          extra check is load-bearing: a server keeps serving its socket after the
          path is unlinked (tmp-cleaners do this; ``kill -USR1 <pid>`` recovers),
          and that produces stderr byte-identical to a socket that never existed.
          Concluding absence from the message alone declared live sessions dead —
          the fail-open this check exists to prevent.

        Everything else raises: permission denied, a path that cannot be resolved
        at all (ENOTDIR, ENAMETOOLONG), an unrecognised message, a nonzero exit
        with no message, a missing socket whose server liveness cannot be
        established, or any unexpected exception from the tmux call itself.

        **What this does NOT guarantee.** The check reaches the server only
        through its socket PATH, so it cannot see a server the path no longer
        leads to:

        * If the path is unlinked and then re-created — by a second tmux server,
          or by an unrelated file or directory — ``list-sessions`` answers about
          the NEW object and reports the original server's sessions absent. (On
          tmux 3.2a a plain file at the path even yields ECONNREFUSED, i.e. the
          confirmed-absence branch above.) No check built on the socket path can
          detect that; it needs a server identity CAO does not record.
        * ``/proc/net/unix`` is per network namespace, so a server holding the
          unlinked socket from another netns reads as absent (it is also
          unreachable from here). The lsof detector has the analogous blind spot:
          unprivileged lsof cannot inspect other users' processes, so a socket
          bound by ANOTHER user's tmux server can read as absent. CAO's own
          server always runs as the same user.
        * Where no socket table can be read at all the liveness probe falls back
          to the process table and answers UNKNOWN for any tmux process it cannot
          attribute to the path. That fails CLOSED, but it means an unrelated
          tmux server can block reconciliation of a dead server's rows on such a
          host. This is now the rare case (no ``/proc/net/unix`` AND no usable
          ``lsof``); in fixup 5 it was every non-Linux host, which blocked
          teardown there permanently.
        * The stderr tables are tmux-version-dependent (see the comment on them).
          Wording from a build we do not recognise lands in the raise branch: a
          loud, non-destructive, re-runnable teardown FAILURE rather than a silent
          false success.

        Behaviour above measured on private sockets against tmux 3.2a / libtmux
        0.51.0 on Linux 6.1 (this repo's dev environment) with BOTH socket-table
        detectors, and, for the stderr wording, tmux 3.7b in fixup 4. The macOS
        lsof behaviour is the reviewer's measurement on macOS; no other BSD has
        been exercised.
