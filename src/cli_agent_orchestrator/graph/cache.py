"""Per-(provider, scope, scope_id, lint_enabled) GraphView cache.

Issue #348, perf follow-up.

DELIBERATE ADR REVERSAL. The original graph-layer design record specified
"lint-on-demand, no caching machinery" (ADR-7): every ``/graph/{provider}``
request re-ran ``wiki_lint.run_lint`` in-request. Profiling the shipped
``memory`` provider on ``scope=global`` measured that projection at ~30s
typical and up to ~148s under load — worse than the frontend's 120s timeout,
so the UI aborted before the server answered. The dominant cost is NOT the LLM
contradiction detector (only ~8.5s / 3 pairs / 0 findings on global) but the
ripgrep-based ``stale_claim`` detector (~20s: ~95 ``rg`` subprocess spawns over
the whole repo). Caching the *projected* GraphView sidesteps the entire run_lint
cost on repeat views regardless of which detector dominates.

This module lives in the graph layer ONLY — it does not touch the shipped
``wiki_lint`` / ``memory_service`` modules (their pure-read / no-cache contracts
are preserved). A ``memory`` GraphProvider opts in by wrapping its build in
``get_or_build``.

Staleness tradeoff (chosen: SHORT TTL, not write-invalidation): wiring
invalidation into the memory write path (``memory_service.store`` / ``forget`` /
``consolidate``) would mean editing a shipped module and reaching across the
graph-layer boundary into it — invasive, and it couples the graph cache to the
memory service's internals. Instead we use a short TTL (``DEFAULT_TTL_S``, 5
min): the graph can be up to TTL seconds stale after a memory edit, which for a
human-viewed knowledge graph is an acceptable price for a self-contained,
boundary-respecting cache. ``invalidate`` is still exposed so a future write-path
hook can wire proactive invalidation without changing this module's shape.
