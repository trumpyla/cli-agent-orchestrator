"""Kiro CLI memory-injection plugin (built-in).

On ``post_create_terminal`` for a ``kiro_cli`` provider, writes the CAO
memory context to ``<cwd>/.kiro/steering/cao-memory.md``. Kiro CLI natively
loads every ``*.md`` file under ``.kiro/steering/``, so this file is picked
up automatically. The plugin owns this file end-to-end and overwrites it
whole on each run (no in-file markers).

Unlike the Claude Code / Codex plugins, the whole-file overwrite means the
lost-update race (defect B) does not apply here — there is no
read-modify-write cycle to serialize, only a full replace. But the target
path is fixed *per working directory* (``<cwd>/.kiro/steering/cao-memory.md``),
so two terminals sharing a cwd still write the same file, and the old
fixed ``.tmp`` idiom is still exposed to defect A (one writer's
``finally``-unlink deleting the other's live temp file → ``FileNotFoundError``,
or a half-written temp being published). ``locked_atomic_rewrite`` closes
that hole too: it uses a unique per-call temp file and an inter-process
lock, so concurrent overwrites are safe even though the content itself does
not depend on the prior file state.

Observer-only: runs after terminal creation, logs-and-skips on every
error path rather than crashing ``cao-server``.
