"""Durable run-journal data-access layer (issue #312, Bolt 4 / N6).

A thin, parameterized-SQL data-access module over the ``workflow_run`` /
``workflow_run_step`` tables (clients/database.py ``_migrate_workflow_run*``).
Per Q1=B the journal is the **source of truth** for workflow run execution
state; the Bolt-3 in-memory ``run_registry`` (``RunRecord``) becomes a cache
rebuilt from these rows on a cold read or after a process restart.

Design constraints (functional-design business-logic-model §0/§1, B4-BR-1..5):

- Zero-arg, self-connecting ``sqlite3.connect(str(DATABASE_FILE))`` — mirrors the
  shipped terminals/inbox/workflow_index helpers; no ORM, no session.
- **Parameterized SQL only** — every value binds through ``?`` placeholders, never
  string interpolation (no injection surface; security-design B4-SD-1).
- ``run_id``/``step_id`` are produced + validated by the engine (B3-BR-1, shared
  ``_validate_key_part``) BEFORE they reach this layer; the journal does NOT
  re-validate ad-hoc (project Mandated rule, B4-BR-2).

These helpers raise ``sqlite3.Error`` on a DB failure; the **caller** (the engine
write-through, business-logic-model §1) wraps them best-effort per B4-BR-5 — a
dropped write never raises into the engine drive loop. The read helpers
(``get_run``/``get_steps``) are used by the rebuild + resume read path.

U3 (issue #312, script-tier journal extension, C3) additively extends this
module: ``RunRow.tier``/``RunRow.generation`` and ``StepRow.call_fingerprint``
surface the U3 columns (domain-entities E1/E2/E3) — additive fields only, no
existing field removed/renamed (INV-1). ``append_step``/``lookup_replay``/
``get_step`` are NEW functions; the existing ``insert_run``/``insert_steps``/
``update_step``/``update_run_current_step``/``update_run_state``/``get_run``/
``get_steps`` are otherwise unchanged in behavior (INV-1) — their SELECT lists
grow to surface the additive columns, but a pre-U3/YAML row reads back with the
INV-2 defaults (``tier='yaml'``, ``generation='1'``, ``call_fingerprint=None``),
which is observably identical to the pre-extension shape.

def _connect() -> sqlite3.Connection:

    Ensures the ``workflow_run`` / ``workflow_run_step`` tables exist first
    (idempotent ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` via the shared migrators) so a
    read/write here never races ``init_db()`` — a process that never went
    through the FastAPI lifespan (e.g. a test that instantiates the app
    without entering it as a context manager) still finds its schema.

    Two properties are added by ``journal-connection-posture`` (issue #583,
    NFR-4). The function's name, signature, return type and callers are
    otherwise unchanged (BR-7):

    - **The migrators run at most once per database path per process** (BR-3),
      guarded by :data:`_MIGRATED_PATHS`. The path is read INSIDE this function
      on every call — never captured at import and never cached beside the set
      (BR-5) — so a process that repoints ``DATABASE_FILE`` mid-run still
      migrates the new path on its next call (BR-4). The path is recorded only
      once the REQUIRED SCHEMA IS VERIFIED PRESENT on the new connection (BR-6,
      corrected by PR #628's review — Copilot F2).

      **"Both migrators returned" was the original condition and it was the
      bug.** Each migrator wraps its whole body in ``except Exception`` ->
      ``logger.debug``, so it returns normally when it FAILS: returning is not
      succeeding. One transient lock or DDL failure therefore cached a
      schema-less database for the rest of the process and prevented every
      later retry — the exact outcome the old comment said the ordering
      avoided. The migrators' swallow-and-log posture is deliberately
      UNCHANGED (other callers depend on it, and it is
      ``business-logic-model.md``'s "Error handling" row 1, outside this
      unit); what changed is that this function no longer takes their return
      as evidence. It asks the database instead, with
      :func:`_journal_schema_is_present`.

      A path that fails verification is simply not cached: the connection is
      still returned (the caller's own query is what will fail, with a real
      SQLite error naming the real problem), and the NEXT call re-runs both
      migrators. That is the retry the cache was destroying.
    - **Every connection carries ``busy_timeout``** (BR-1/BR-2). It is a
      per-connection setting rather than a database property, so it cannot be
      memoised alongside the migration state and is set on each new connection.
      At the current value this pragma is a runtime NO-OP: CPython's
      ``sqlite3.connect()`` already applies a 5000 ms busy timeout via its
      ``timeout=5.0`` default, which it implements with
      ``sqlite3_busy_timeout``. It is set explicitly anyway for two reasons —
      the value gets a single named home that can be revised without editing
      this module, and the guarantee survives a future caller passing
      ``timeout=0`` or a change to that stdlib default. It does NOT widen the
      contention window; the per-call cost this function actually removes is
      the migrator DDL above. WAL — which *is* a database-level property,
      shared with every other CAO subsystem using this file — is deliberately
      NOT set here (BR-8, ADR-583-10).

    The timeout is interpolated from the module-level constant and from nothing
    else (SR-1): SQLite accepts no bound parameter for ``PRAGMA busy_timeout``,
    so this is this module's one interpolated statement and its source must
    stay a trusted constant.

def apply_decisions(run_id: str, decisions: Mapping[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Apply a human's per-step recovery decisions to one run's rows (FR-7, BR-1..BR-10).

    The escape hatch for a halt: the replay gate can return ``DECISION_REQUIRED``,
    and this is the only thing that resolves one. Called on the resume path BEFORE
    the script is spawned (BR-7) — the gate reads journal rows, so a decision applied
    after the spawn would be invisible to the step it was meant to resolve.

    **THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE REQUIREMENT, NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION CHOICE**
    (SR-2/SR-3/SR-6, RL-1). Read, then validate the WHOLE map, then write inside ONE
    transaction, then log:

    1. read this run's existing step rows (:func:`get_steps`);
    2. validate EVERY entry — nothing is written yet;
    3. one ``with _connect() as conn:`` block, N single-row UPDATEs of ``state``;
    4. AFTER the commit, one warning per decision.

    **Why validate-then-write rather than iterate-and-write** (SR-2, the one threat
    this unit introduces). This function takes a MAP, so a typo in the third entry
    would otherwise leave the first two already transitioned while the operator sees
    their resume REJECTED — ``step-a`` would hold durable consent to re-execute a
    side-effecting step, granted by a command that reported failure. BR-9 makes
    consent one-shot so it cannot outlive its ATTEMPT; this ordering stops it
    outliving its own REJECTION.

    **Why one transaction as WELL as up-front validation** (SR-3/TD-4). The two guard
    different failures and neither is redundant: validation catches operator error at
    the boundary, the transaction catches a database failure part-way through the
    writes. ``with _connect() as conn:`` commits on clean exit and rolls back on an
    exception, which is sufficient — deliberately NOT the ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` unit
    6's TD-2a considered, because this is a single-writer, human-initiated path and
    not a two-process race (concurrent resumes of the SAME run are rejected upstream
    with 409 before this function is reached, SC-3).

    **Only ``state`` moves** (BR-8/SR-9/RL-4). ``attempts``, ``result_json``,
    ``output_json``, ``error``, ``call_fingerprint`` and ``updated_at`` are untouched,
    so the record of what actually happened outlives the decision about what to do
    next — which is what makes a halt diagnosable afterwards (FR-12).

    **It never silently no-ops** (BR-6/RL-2/INV-3). An unknown ``step_id`` or an
    unknown decision value raises, because a swallowed typo would let the run halt
    again at the same step with no signal that the decision never landed — and the
    operator would re-issue the same typo indefinitely, concluding the halt mechanism
    is broken. An EMPTY map is not that case: no decision was supplied, so it returns
    without reading, writing or logging.

    **The log line is the one place this module logs, and its position is a rule**
    (SR-6/TD-6). Its neighbours deliberately leave logging to the caller — a caller
    knows more about a no-op than the primitive does. This function is different: it
    is the subsystem's only permission grant, so the grant itself is the evidence and
    only this function holds it. The line goes AFTER the commit and on the success
    path ONLY: logging before the commit would record a decision that then rolled
    back, and a log claiming consent was granted when it was not is worse than no log
    at all. A rejection needs no line — it already surfaces as a 400 to the operator
    who caused it. Identifiers only: ``run_id``, ``step_id``, the decision and the
    state it wrote — never a fingerprint, an envelope or any step content (SR-5).

    A durable, queryable record of *which operator authorised this, and when* is a
    known gap: neither existing log fits (``event_log_service`` is an in-process ring
    buffer; ``audit_log`` is the MEMORY audit log and short-circuits when memory is
    disabled), and a durable workflow event log is the parked #505 work. Recorded as
    an accepted residual in this unit's ``security-requirements.md`` rather than
    papered over; when #505 lands, this line is where the decision joins the timeline.

    **IT RETURNS THE PRIOR STATES, so consent can be revoked (PR #628 review, Copilot
    F6).** The return value is new and additive — every existing caller ignores it. It
    exists because BR-9's "one decision authorises exactly ONE attempt" was only HALF
    implemented: ``begin_step`` consumes ``rerun_authorized`` by flipping the row to
    ``running``, but NOTHING consumes ``replay_authorized`` (a replay writes no row, by
    design), and a resume that fails after this commit leaves either state live for the
    next resume to consume. Reverting needs the state that was overwritten, and this
    function is the only place that still knows it. :func:`revoke_unconsumed_decisions`
    is the other half; ``script_runner.resume_script_run`` holds the pair together.

    Args:
        run_id: the run being resumed. Its rows are the only ones touched.
        decisions: ``step_id`` -> decision, where a value is a ``RecoveryDecision``
            member or the equivalent string. Annotated ``str`` because
            ``RecoveryDecision`` IS a ``(str, Enum)`` and the boundary hands raw JSON
            strings: :func:`parse_decision` is the single validation point for both
            forms (BR-10), so no surface can accept a value another rejects.

    Returns:
        ``step_id`` -> the state each row held BEFORE this call, for exactly the steps
        written. Empty for an empty ``decisions`` map. Hand it to
        :func:`revoke_unconsumed_decisions` when the drive this consent was granted for
        is over.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if any ``step_id`` is absent from this run, or any value is not a
            recovery decision. The message names the offending ``step_id`` and
            carries identifiers only (SR-4/SR-5). Raised BEFORE any write, so the
            rows are untouched; the resume route's existing bare-``ValueError`` arm
            maps it to 400 — correct, because a mistyped ``step_id`` is a client
            error and a 500 would tell the operator to file a bug instead of fixing a
            typo.

    THE MISSING HALF OF BR-9's "one decision authorises exactly ONE attempt". The other half
    already worked for one case: ``begin_step`` flips a ``rerun_authorized`` row to ``running``,
    so a dispatched rerun cannot be re-authorised by the same decision. Three cases were not
    covered, and the third is not a crash case at all:

    1. the resume FAILS after :func:`apply_decisions` commits — a raising generation bump or
       snapshot materialisation — and the consent survives a command that reported failure;
    2. the drive runs but never reaches the decided step (an earlier step halts), so nothing
       dispatches it and ``rerun_authorized`` stands;
    3. a ``skip`` is NEVER consumed by anything, on any path, because a replay writes no row
       BY DESIGN. One ``skip`` was therefore standing authorisation for every future resume of
       that run — which is precisely what the CLI, the MCP tool, ``docs/workflows.md``, the
       authoring guide and ``SKILL.md`` all promise it is not.

    A COMPARE-AND-SET, NEVER A BLIND WRITE. Each ``UPDATE`` carries
    ``AND state = <the authorised value>``, so a row the drive DID move — to ``running``,
    ``completed``, ``failed``, or anything else — is not matched and cannot be clobbered. That
    is what makes this safe to call unconditionally at the end of every decided resume, and it
    is why the caller does not have to work out which steps were consumed: the database
    answers, atomically, from the state itself.

    ``spec_snapshot`` / ``inputs_json``) so a multi-row list stays small.

    - ``state`` — when not ``None``, a ``WHERE state = ?`` clause filters to that
      one RunState string. Legality of the value is validated one layer up; a
      well-formed but unmatched string simply returns ``[]`` (QR-2, LR-2). The
      value binds through a ``?`` placeholder — never string-interpolated, so a
      value carrying SQL metacharacters is a harmless literal (QR-1).
    - ``limit`` — clamped to ``[1, 500]`` (values ``< 1`` become ``1``, values
      ``> 500`` become ``500``); ``offset`` is floored at ``0``. The clamp bounds
      a single list response regardless of the caller.
    - Ordering is ``started_at DESC, run_id DESC``. The ``run_id DESC`` tiebreaker
      is mandatory, not decoration: ``started_at`` is a whole-second ISO string,
      so two runs started in the same second collide on the primary key; without
      the tiebreaker their order — and offset paging — would be undefined (QR-3).

    An empty result (empty table or a filter that matches nothing) is a valid
    answer returned as ``[]``, never an error (LR-3). Like the sibling reads
    (``get_run`` / ``get_steps``) this raises ``sqlite3.Error`` on a DB failure

    future caller of the reserved ``lookup_replay`` primitive has a stable value
    to compare. The
    completion transition (RUNNING -> COMPLETED/FAILED) reuses the base
    ``update_step`` UNCHANGED (INV-1).

    ``ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`` upserts ``state``/``updated_at`` only — a
    re-executed tail step (e.g. a second resume attempt over the same call)
    already has a prior-attempt row; this is NOT a swallowed IntegrityError, it
    is the documented A1 upsert. ``call_fingerprint`` is deliberately excluded
    from the ``DO UPDATE`` clause so it stays stable across attempts (VR-4) —
    the fingerprint recorded at the FIRST arrival of this ``(run_id, step_id)``
    is the one ``lookup_replay`` compares against on every subsequent attempt.

    **This function is no longer the only writer of ``call_fingerprint``**
    (corrected by ``journal-step-lifecycle``, issue #583, BR-11 — the VR-4
    exclusivity claim this docstring used to make became false the moment
    :func:`begin_step` landed beside it, and is removed here rather than left to
    contradict the code in the same module). The two writers own two regimes,
    and the split is the point:

    - **this function — the YAML tier**: the fingerprint is fixed at the FIRST
      arrival of a ``(run_id, step_id)`` and never moves, because the column is
      excluded from the ``DO UPDATE`` above.
    - **:func:`begin_step` — the script tier**: the fingerprint is RE-BASELINED
      on conflict whenever the prior row is not ``completed`` (BR-7), so a step
      re-dispatched after a failure or a human rerun decision records the
      fingerprint of the call actually about to run. A ``completed`` row's
      fingerprint is preserved, which is the same stability this function
      provides unconditionally.

    """Write the durable RUNNING row for a script call, carrying its fingerprint (A).

    The first half of the split write. Called at terminal creation, BEFORE the
    call executes, so a crash in the execution window leaves the row ``running``
    — a state ``lookup_replay``'s existing partial guard already rejects — rather
    than ``completed`` with no result.

    ``attempts`` is absent from the ``DO UPDATE`` clause (BR-8). This function
    never moves the count; :func:`settle_step` owns it. A second ``begin_step``
    on a step already settled three times must not reset it to 0.

    **Why ``call_fingerprint`` is written conditionally.** :func:`append_step`
    excludes the column from its conflict clause outright, which fixes the
    fingerprint at first arrival forever. That is right for the YAML tier and
    wrong for the script tier: a step re-dispatched after a failure — or after a
    human authorises a rerun — would keep a fingerprint recorded against a call
    that is not the one about to run (possibly under a superseded hashing
    scheme), and every later resume would halt again on the same step. The
    ``CASE`` therefore re-baselines the fingerprint while the prior row is not
    terminal, and preserves it once the row is ``completed`` — a completed row's
    fingerprint is the one recorded against a real result, which is exactly what
    ``lookup_replay`` must keep comparing against (BR-7, INV-3).

    **The condition is an open negative — ``!= 'completed'`` — and must stay
    one.** Rewriting it as an allowlist of the states known today would silently
    stop re-baselining the moment ``recovery-decision-intake`` (unit 12) adds
    ``rerun_authorized``, reinstating the permanent-halt bug the rule exists to
    kill. A test pins that an arbitrary unknown state value still re-baselines.

    ``'running'`` is a bare string literal, matching how this module already
    spells state values (``lookup_replay``, ``settle_run_state_if_running``);
    the module gains no ``models`` dependency for one literal (BR-12, TD-4). A
    test pins the literal equal to ``StepState.RUNNING.value`` from the test
    file's own import, so a rename on either side fails loudly.

    Raises ``sqlite3.Error`` on a DB failure and swallows nothing (BR-3): the
    best-effort posture belongs to the caller (``record_step_completion``), so a
    journal failure degrades resumability and never fails a running step (INV-4).

    """Settle a script call's row — state, count, envelope, output, error — atomically (B).

    The second half of the split write, and the whole of FR-4 guard 1: ``state``,
    ``attempts``, ``result_json``, ``output_json`` and ``error`` land in ONE
    statement on ONE connection, so there is no window in which the row reads
    settled and carries no result (BR-1, INV-1). A failure writes nothing and
    leaves the row as :func:`begin_step` set it — ``running``, which is not
    settled (BR-2). Atomic means never half-written, not never-failing.

    Returns ``True`` when a row already existed and ``False`` when this settle
    created it — the no-begin rescue path below. The caller logs that
    distinction (BR-13, TD-2); this function emits no log line, exactly as
    :func:`settle_run_state_if_running` leaves its own no-op to the caller,
    "because a silent no-op is indistinguishable from a broken guard when
    reading logs after an incident". A single ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
    UPDATE`` cannot report which branch it took (``cursor.rowcount`` is 1 either
    way), so the branch is detected by a primary-key ``SELECT`` on the same
    connection, immediately before the upsert. ``RETURNING`` would detect it in
    one statement but appears nowhere in ``src/`` and needs SQLite 3.35+, which
    is not verified at the project's CI floor (TD-2).

    **The scope of that detection, stated precisely rather than overclaimed.**
    The ``SELECT`` and the upsert share one connection and one ``with`` block,
    but NOT one transaction: with the stdlib's legacy transaction control
    (``isolation_level=""``) an implicit ``BEGIN`` fires at the first DML
    statement, so a plain ``SELECT`` runs in autocommit and opens no read
    transaction — verified on CPython 3.12.9 / SQLite 3.47.1, where a second
    connection can insert the same key between the two statements without
    blocking. So the returned ``bool`` is an accurate report of what this process
    saw a moment before its write, and it can under-report (``False`` while
    another process created the row in that gap, leaving this statement to take
    the conflict path). It never mis-reports ``True``: nothing in ``src/`` deletes
    a ``workflow_run_step`` row.

    That residual is bounded and deliberate. **BR-1 does not depend on it** — the
    settle itself is one statement and stays atomic whatever the read said — and
    the value feeds a diagnostic warning, not a control-flow decision, so the
    worst case is one missing log line in a race between two processes settling
    the SAME step. Making it exact would need an explicit ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``
    around both statements, which no other helper in this module takes and which
    would widen the write lock across a read for a log line.

    **It is an UPSERT, not an UPDATE** (BR-4). The no-prior-row case is live
    today — ``script_runner.record_step_completion`` already defends against a
    terminal-created callback that never fired — and a bare ``UPDATE`` there
    would affect 0 rows and discard the settled result silently. That is strictly
    worse than the half-written row guard 1 prevents: the replay gate can reject
    a settled row with no envelope, but it cannot reject a row that does not
    exist.

    **``attempts`` is owned by the SQL and is not a parameter** (BR-5, BR-6):
    ``1`` on the INSERT path, ``existing + 1`` on conflict, so the durable count
    means *total settles ever recorded for this step* and never moves backwards.
    The caller's in-process counter restarts at 0 after a resume, so a
    caller-supplied count would drag a row reading 3 back to 1 — untruthful
    under FR-12. ``component-methods.md`` specifies an ``attempts`` argument;
    it is dropped here on the human's ruling (TD-3), because an argument that is
    accepted and ignored reads as authoritative. Unit 8's call site passes none.

    **``call_fingerprint`` is never written here** (BR-9). On the conflict path
    the column keeps whatever :func:`begin_step` recorded; on the INSERT path it
    stays ``NULL``, so a row rescued from the no-begin path has *absent*
    provenance. That is the intended outcome, not a gap — absent provenance
    routes to a halt rather than a replay match, which makes the rescued result
    durably visible to a human (INV-5).

    **This function sanitises nothing** (BR-14, SR-2). ``result_json``,
    ``output_json`` and ``error`` are persisted as received; it pulls in neither
    unit 2's envelope builder nor its redaction gate, and no security logic lives
    inside a persistence primitive. The caller owns redacting AND bounding both
    remaining content columns, and ``settlement-rewire`` (unit 8) is where that
    is assigned. Until unit 8 lands, a settled row carries a redacted, bounded
    envelope beside a raw, unbounded ``error`` and ``output_json`` — pre-existing
    behaviour that ``update_step`` already has and this function does not
    worsen, recorded as an accepted residual risk in this unit's
    ``security-requirements.md`` SR-3/SR-4 rather than left implicit.

    Raises ``sqlite3.Error`` on a DB failure and swallows nothing (BR-3).

    """Read a run's events and DECLARE any sequence gaps (Algorithm 2, BR-4).

    The stored per-run sequence is contiguous when complete (BR-1), so a hole is
    detectable: wherever a row's ``seq`` exceeds the previous ``seq`` by more than
    one, a ``GapMarker`` is synthesized spanning the missing range. The sequence
    is never renumbered to hide the gap — the marker lets a client tell "nothing
    happened" from "an event was lost" (FR-3.3). Returns ``(rows, gaps)``.

    A hole between two stored rows is found by the adjacency scan below. A
    TRAILING hole — the last append(s) before a crash were swallowed, so the
    missing seqs sit past the final stored row with no successor to compare
    against — is invisible to that scan, and is exactly the forward-fault shape
    the two-term design exists to catch. It is recovered from the durable
    high-water: the counter is advanced and persisted BEFORE each fallible
    append, so ``persisted_high_water`` is the last seq ever ALLOCATED while the
    last stored row is the last seq that actually LANDED. When the former
    exceeds the latter, the difference is a real declared hole at the end.

    The trailing marker uses ``before_seq = high_water + 1`` — one past the last
    allocated seq — because no stored event bounds it on the right. That is a
    deliberate sentinel: it keeps ``missing_count == before_seq - after_seq - 1``
    arithmetic identical to an interior gap, and it never collides with a real
    event's seq (nothing has been allocated at ``high_water + 1`` yet).

    A trailing gap is declared ONLY for a run in a terminal state. Because the
    high-water is persisted BEFORE each fallible append, a RUNNING run
    legitimately sits one seq ahead for the duration of every in-flight append —
    declaring on that window would emit a phantom gap on essentially every poll
    of every live run. Once the run is terminal no further append can land, so
    the excess is a real, permanent hole. This makes the check quiet by
    construction rather than relying on a timing tolerance.

    That invariant depends on ``_drive`` appending a run's terminal EVENT before
    it writes the terminal STATE. The reverse order (state first) opened a window
    in which a perfectly healthy completed run read as a trailing loss, because
    the run row said ``completed`` while its final append was still in flight —
    see the ordering comment in ``workflow_service._drive``. Do not reorder those
    two writes without re-reading this guard.

    A from-start read (``after_seq is None``) seeds the comparison at ``0`` —
    one below the first allocatable seq — unconditionally, so the from-start and
    cursor-at-0 reads agree on every shape: leading, interior, trailing, and
    total loss. Healthy runs are unaffected (first seq is 1, and an empty run has
    ``high_water == 0``), so the quiet cases stay quiet.
