    """Manages FIFO lifecycle: create named pipe, start reader thread, stop and cleanup.

    Also runs a pipe-pane liveness watchdog (issue #388): tmux can silently
    stop forwarding a pane's output to the FIFO after a burst of alternate-screen
    redraws — the pane keeps rendering but the piped copy freezes, and nothing
    errors (``pane_pipe`` still reports 1, the reader thread is healthy, there is
    simply no data to read). From inside the FIFO reader a stalled forwarder is
    indistinguishable from a genuinely idle terminal, so the watchdog compares
    tmux's *live* pane content against whether the FIFO delivered any bytes: pane
    diverged from its last known-healthy baseline + FIFO silent = a stall, which
    it self-heals by re-arming the pipe. The baseline is pinned across checks
    (not just the previous one) so a stall that settles into a new static frame
    right after the burst — instead of staying visibly in flux — is still caught
    (harness-control#148).

    Also runs a separate cold-start check (harness-control#93): the
    divergence logic above can only ever catch a pipe that WAS delivering
    and then stalled — it needs a baseline to diverge from. A pipe that has
    been dead since the terminal was created never gets one: an already-idle
    shell prompt renders once and then never changes, so every check sees
    identical content and "diverged" is permanently False. This is the
    common, live-reproduced shape of #93 — a shell that IS genuinely ready,
    sitting on a stable prompt, whose FIFO simply never forwarded anything
    (tmux's ``pipe-pane -o`` only captures output produced after it attaches;
    a fast shell can draw its prompt in the same instant, and the guaranteed
    "nudge a fresh prompt through the pipe" keystroke terminal_service.py
    already sends is not 100% reliable under load). The cold-start check is
    independent of any baseline: has the FIFO delivered ANYTHING since
    registration, within a short, fixed grace period? If not — and the live
    pane already shows real content — re-arm immediately instead of waiting
    on a divergence that structurally cannot happen.

        Never blocks in a FIFO ``open()`` (issue #382): the previous design
        opened the pipe with a plain blocking ``O_RDONLY`` and reopened on
        every EOF, which parked the thread in the kernel's ``wait_for_partner``
        whenever no writer was attached. ``stop_reader``'s write-side wakeup
        only worked if the thread happened to be inside ``open()`` at that
        instant — miss the window (post-EOF reopen, error sleep) and the
        thread was stranded forever on an inode whose name had been unlinked.
        Accumulated leaks eventually wedged the whole server.

        Instead:
        - the read end is opened ``O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK``, which succeeds
          immediately for a FIFO even with no writer;
        - a keepalive write end is held by this process, so the pipe never
          reaches writer-count zero — ``select`` therefore only reports the fd
          readable when actual data arrives (avoiding the busy EOF spin a
          writer-less non-blocking FIFO would otherwise produce), and tmux
          detaching its ``pipe-pane`` writer produces no EOF churn at all;
        - ``select`` uses a timeout so the stop flag is observed within
          ``_POLL_INTERVAL`` seconds regardless of traffic.

        Chunks are also coalesced (``_COALESCE_WINDOW``) before publishing.
        Kiro's TUI animates a spinner at ~10 fps and each frame is a separate
        FIFO write — publishing one event per raw read floods the shared
        async queue (1024 slots, drop-on-full), and the dropped events wiped
        out worker state transitions that assign/handoff rely on. Batching
        every 50ms of chunks into one event drops the publish rate ~20x
        during bursts while staying well under the status monitor's 200ms
        quiescence debounce, so detection is unaffected and consumers see
        the same bytes in the same order.

        Liveness bookkeeping for the pipe-pane watchdog (issue #388) is
        recorded independent of coalescing, right when bytes are pulled off
        the FIFO — the watchdog only cares whether the FIFO delivered data
        in a window, not whether/when that data was published.

        """One liveness check for a terminal: re-arm a stalled pipe-pane forwarder.

        A stalled forwarder is invisible from inside the FIFO reader (no bytes to
        read, exactly like an idle terminal). The only ground truth is tmux's own
        live pane content, which keeps rendering through the stall. So:

        - pane content has diverged from the last known-healthy baseline AND the
          FIFO has delivered no bytes since        -> the pipe is stalled: re-arm.
        - pane content matches the baseline                        -> idle: do nothing.
        - FIFO delivered bytes since the last check       -> healthy: re-baseline.

        The baseline is pinned to the pane content last observed while the FIFO
        was confirmed delivering data (or the first-ever observation) — NOT to
        the immediately-previous check's content. This matters for a "burst-then-
        settle" stall: tmux can silently stop forwarding mid-burst and the pane
        then settles into a new, different, static frame before the next poll
        observes it (e.g. an AskUserQuestion menu finishing its render and
        sitting idle awaiting input — harness-control#148's live repro). Comparing
        only against the immediately-previous check's content would see exactly
        one diverging check (baseline -> new frame) followed by unchanging checks
        thereafter (new frame -> same new frame), resetting the strike counter to
        0 forever — even though the FIFO-fed buffer is permanently stuck on stale
        mid-burst content. Pinning the baseline until the FIFO actually delivers
        data again means every check keeps comparing against the ORIGINAL
        pre-stall content, so a settle-and-freeze keeps accumulating strikes
        exactly like an ongoing divergence would.

        Requiring BOTH "diverged from baseline" and "FIFO silent" is what stops a
        legitimately idle terminal (pane unchanged, FIFO silent) from triggering
        a needless re-pipe. Re-arm only after ``PIPE_LIVENESS_STALL_CHECKS``
        consecutive checks confirm the divergence persists (default 2 — a single
        diverging check can be a false positive on a healthy-but-bursty pipe).

        Before any of that, a separate cold-start check (harness-control#93)
        runs first: has the FIFO delivered ANYTHING since the terminal was
        registered, within ``PIPE_LIVENESS_COLD_START_GRACE_S``? This is not
        a variant of the divergence logic — it is checked instead of it,
        because divergence requires a healthy baseline to diverge FROM, and a
        pipe that's been dead since t=0 never gets one. See module docstring.

        Bytes lost during the stall are gone (tmux never buffered them), but
