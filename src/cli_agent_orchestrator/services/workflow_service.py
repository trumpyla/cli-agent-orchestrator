"""Workflow run engine (issue #312, Bolt 3 / N5).

The deterministic, in-memory orchestration engine: it holds the process-local run
registry and the sequencing / bounded-retry / reprompt-once / templating logic that
drives a validated ``WorkflowSpec`` through ``run_agent_step`` one step at a time.

Boundary discipline (B3-BR-14/B3-BR-15):

- The engine runs IN the API process and calls ``run_agent_step`` directly,
  in-process — it NEVER reaches back through the HTTP API (single seam).
- A step failure is recorded as ``StepState.FAILED`` ON THE RUN RECORD; it does
  NOT raise into the run loop. Only engine-internal invariant violations raise the
  typed ``WorkflowEngineError`` (mapped to HTTP 500 at the boundary). Domain errors
  map narrowly at the boundary: unknown run/spec -> 404, invalid spec/inputs -> 400,
  cancel-of-finished -> 409.
- Reserved seams (parallel / loop / resume) raise ``NotBuiltYetError`` when reached
  — never silently downgraded to sequential (B3-BR-10, honest-tiering).

The algorithm is implemented exactly per ``functional-design/business-logic-model.md``
(§1 start_run, §2/§2a the two nested loops, §3 _collect_structured_output, §4
_substitute, §5 cancel_run, §6 get_run_status, §7 reserved seams).
