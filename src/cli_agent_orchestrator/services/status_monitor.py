# Statuses that represent a stable "ready" state — the agent has finished
# producing output and is waiting for further input. Once latched, the
# StatusMonitor will not regress to PROCESSING until ``notify_input_sent``
# is called (signalling that a new processing cycle is starting).
#
# Why: the event-driven pipeline derives status from a rolling state buffer,
# and TUI redraws (cursor positioning, status-bar refreshes) routinely
# evict the idle/response markers that the per-provider get_status() relies
# on. That makes status flap rapidly between IDLE/COMPLETED and PROCESSING
# in the seconds following completion. Without stickiness, both
# wait_until_status (server-side) and the e2e tests' HTTP polling miss the
# brief "ready" windows and time out (PR #273 codex 60s init timeouts,
# completion-timeout failures).
