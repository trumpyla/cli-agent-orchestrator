"""Session service for session-level operations.

This module provides session management functionality for CAO, where a "session"
corresponds to a tmux session that may contain multiple terminal windows (agents).

Session Hierarchy:
- Session: A tmux session (e.g., "cao-my-project")
  - Terminal: A tmux window within the session (e.g., "developer-abc123")
    - Provider: The CLI agent running in the terminal (e.g., KiroCliProvider)

Key Operations:
- list_sessions(): Get all CAO-managed sessions (filtered by SESSION_PREFIX)
- get_session(): Get session details including all terminal metadata
- delete_session(): Clean up session, providers, database records, and tmux session

Session Lifecycle:
1. create_terminal() with new_session=True creates a new tmux session
2. Additional terminals are added via create_terminal() with new_session=False
3. delete_session() removes the entire session and all contained terminals

Transitions 1/2 and 3 are mutually exclusive per session NAME, via the lifecycle
lock in ``services/session_lock.py`` — see ``delete_session`` for why.

def delete_session(session_name: str, registry: PluginRegistry | None = None) -> Dict:
    """Delete session and cleanup, reconciling tmux and the registry atomically.

    Two properties make the two stores impossible to diverge (#498):

    **Mutual exclusion.** The whole critical section — enumerate rows, capture
    scrollback, confirm tmux gone, dismantle runtimes, delete rows — runs under
    the per-session-name lifecycle lock (``services/session_lock.py``) — the SAME
    lock ``create_terminal`` holds while it creates a session/window and writes
    the matching row. Without it no ordering discipline helps: a create landing
    mid-teardown can put a live tmux session under this name after we have
    already decided the name is dead, and a second concurrent teardown can
    double-kill and double-sweep. Serializing per NAME leaves teardowns of
    DIFFERENT sessions fully concurrent.

    **Nothing is dismantled until the kill is confirmed.** There is therefore
    nothing to roll back, and no snapshot/restore machinery: an earlier revision
    deleted rows first and restored them from a snapshot on failure, which both
    reconstructed them lossily (``last_active`` was dropped) and restored ONLY
    the rows — the FIFO reader, status-monitor buffers and provider registration
    stayed torn down, so the "restored" terminal was a zombie, a row that looked
    live with no pipeline behind it. Ordering:

    1. Enumerate the incarnation's rows under the lock. Because the lock also
       covers creation, this list cannot grow behind us — a concurrent create is
       either fully included or has not started.
    2. Snapshot each terminal's scrollback/metadata
       (``capture_terminal_snapshot``). This must precede the kill (scrollback
       only exists while the pane does), and it is safe there because it is
       READ-ONLY with respect to terminal state — it reads tmux and writes two
       files under the log directory. If the kill then fails to confirm, no
       terminal has been touched.
    3. Check liveness STRICTLY: a lookup error must not be misread as "gone".
       ``session_exists`` collapses any error to False, which would drop the
       registry while the session may be alive.
    4. If the session is alive, ``kill_session`` — which per the backend
       contract returns True only once the session is CONFIRMED gone, and False
       for both a failed kill and an already-absent target. A False is
       disambiguated by a strict follow-up check: confirmed gone (it vanished
       between the check and the kill lookup) is SUCCESS; still provably alive
       is a real failure. Killing the SESSION kills every window in it, so no
       per-window kill is needed first — and doing it this way is what lets the
       destructive work all sit after the confirmation.
    5. Only now that tmux is provably gone: dismantle each terminal's runtime
       (``dismantle_terminal_runtime`` with ``kill_window=False`` — the windows
       died with the session), then delete the rows (scoped by id via
       ``delete_terminals_by_ids``, so a same-name session created after this
       teardown finishes keeps its own rows), and drop the forwarded-env mapping.
       Every step here is individually guarded: past the confirmation point the
       teardown has succeeded, so a failing step is reported in ``errors`` rather
       than raised — raising would both misreport a completed teardown and, since
       dispatch is deferred to 6, lose every event for it.
    6. Release the lock, THEN emit ``post_kill_terminal`` per torn-down terminal
       followed by ``post_kill_session``. No plugin code runs inside the critical
       section — see the dispatch loop for why that matters on the API path.

    A terminal whose runtime teardown DEFERS (``dismantle_terminal_runtime``
    returns False — Grok has not yet released its private home, #596) keeps its
    row: that row is the only retry handle for the deferred cleanup, so it is
    neither deleted in step 5 nor swept, the session is reported in ``errors``
    instead of ``deleted``, and a re-run finishes the job. The tmux session is
    still gone by then — the deferral is about on-disk provider state, not about
    the session — so this is a partially-complete teardown, which is exactly what
    the caller is told.

    If tmux cannot be confirmed dead we raise having changed nothing but two
    snapshot files: the surviving session keeps its rows, its FIFO readers, its
    status-monitor state and its providers, so it is still a fully working
    session rather than a half-dismantled one, and a re-run reconciles it.

    NOTE — how far the guarantee actually reaches. It rests on two backend
    properties, and is exactly as strong as the weaker one:

    * ``kill_session`` returning True only once the session is confirmed gone.
      TmuxBackend polls; HerdrBackend does not yet (it returns the close
      subprocess's exit code without a liveness check).
    * ``session_exists_strict`` distinguishing absence from an unanswerable
      lookup. TmuxBackend does, by classifying a ``list-sessions`` exit status
      itself (``clients/tmux.py``); the ABC default just delegates to the lenient
      ``session_exists``, which collapses any error to "absent" and so fails OPEN.

    On a backend with the default strict check, therefore, this teardown is no
    safer than the pre-fix behavior in the lookup-error case — a transient error
    still reads as "gone" and the rows still get dropped. The tmux path answers
    False only on positive evidence of absence (its docstring lists the residual
    holes it cannot close); herdr's does not, and it is not made worse here.
    Tracked as a follow-up.
