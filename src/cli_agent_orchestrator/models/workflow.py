"""Workflow spec domain model + grammar validation (issue #312, unit N1).

This module defines the native multi-agent workflow object: a trusted-author
YAML spec describing a DAG of agent steps. Bolt 1 ships only the *grammar* —
the Pydantic model, the aggregating ``validate_grammar`` model-validator, and
the non-raising ``validate_only`` service surface. It NEVER executes a spec.

Key invariants (see functional-design/business-rules.md):
- BR-1: spec name + every step id match ``WORKFLOW_NAME_RE``; step ids unique.
- BR-3: a construct being *reserved* (unit not shipped) is NEVER a grammar
  error. Reserved tagging is ``validate_only``'s job, surfaced honestly
  ("construct X is reserved (not built yet)") — never "X will run".
- BR-4: a loop step MUST declare all three guards (max_iterations, on_stall,
  on_no_progress) — a *structural* floor enforced now even though loop
  execution is N8.
- BR-6: ``output_schema``, if present, MUST be well-formed JSON-Schema
  (validated with the jsonschema library's own meta-schema — SD-3.1).
- BR-7: ``validate_grammar`` raises one aggregated ``ValueError`` (never
  fail-on-first); ``validate_only`` NEVER raises — it returns a
  ``ValidationResult``.

``NotBuiltYetError`` is *defined* here but RAISED only by the run engine (N5,
Bolt 3) when sequencing reaches a reserved construct. Bolt 1 never raises it.
