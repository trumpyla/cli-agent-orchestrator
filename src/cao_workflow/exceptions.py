"""Shim exception hierarchy (E3, and the original WorkflowShim design's
BR-1/BR-4/BR-6/BR-17 — NOT issue #583's ``shim-step-surface`` rules of the same
numbers, whose BR-8 is the recovery key rather than anything here).

Never caught by the shim itself — every failure raises to the author's own
``except`` block or crashes the script (no retry, no recovery, no silent
fallback).

Note for authors: ``ShimHTTPError`` carries a resume HALT and a resume
DIVERGENCE as well as ordinary failures — both arrive as ``.status == 409``
(issue #583). Because it subclasses ``ShimError``, a blanket
``except ShimError`` absorbs them; see the authoring guide.
