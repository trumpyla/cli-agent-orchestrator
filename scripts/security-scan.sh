# Local mirror of the `security` and `codeql` CI jobs so contributors can catch
# SSRF/path-injection/SCA/secret findings before pushing. Exits non-zero on any
# scanner failure so it's safe to wire into pre-push hooks or Makefile targets.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/security-scan.sh                 # run every available scanner
#   scripts/security-scan.sh trivy           # just Trivy
#   scripts/security-scan.sh codeql          # just CodeQL (python)
#   scripts/security-scan.sh gitleaks        # just gitleaks (secret scan, #457)
#
# CodeQL installs from Homebrew (macOS) are often broken by Apple's Gatekeeper
# quarantine (xattr errors followed by silent exit 1). If that's happening,
# either run CodeQL via Docker (see below) or rely on the GitHub Action.

# This scan passes NO severity filter, deliberately (#568). The CI `security`
# job does pass `severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'`, but trivy-action's entrypoint.sh
# runs `unset TRIVY_SEVERITY` whenever `format` is sarif and
# `limit-severities-for-sarif` is not true — and CI uses `format: 'sarif'`.
# So that input is DISCARDED and the gate fails on a finding of ANY severity
# ("Building SARIF report with all severities" in the job log). A local check
# narrowed to CRITICAL,HIGH passes while CI goes red, which is exactly how
# #568 was missed. It likewise passes no scanner filter: CI supplies no such
# input either, so Trivy runs its default scanner set — the job log shows both
# [vuln] and [secret] scanning enabled. Narrowing either axis here would make
# this wrapper weaker than the gate it claims to mirror; don't reintroduce it.
