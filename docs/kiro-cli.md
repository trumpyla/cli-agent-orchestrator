# Kiro CLI Provider

## Overview

The Kiro CLI provider enables CLI Agent Orchestrator (CAO) to work with **Kiro CLI**, an AI-powered coding assistant that operates through agent-based conversations with customizable profiles.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS Credentials**: Kiro CLI authenticates via AWS
2. **Kiro CLI**: Install the CLI tool
3. **tmux**: Required for terminal management

```bash
# Install Kiro CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/kiro-cli

# Verify authentication
kiro-cli --version
```

### Using Kiro CLI Provider with CAO

```bash
# Start the CAO server
cao-server

# Launch a Kiro CLI-backed session (agent profile is required)
cao launch --agents developer --provider kiro_cli --engine v2
```

Via HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9889/sessions?provider=kiro_cli&agent_profile=developer"
```

**Note**: Kiro CLI requires an agent profile — it cannot be launched without one.

`--engine v2` is explicit but optional because v2 is the default. `--engine kas`
is an opt-in Phase 0 selection; CAO capability-probes it and currently rejects it
before terminal allocation rather than claiming runtime KAS support.

## Features

### Status Detection

The Kiro CLI provider detects terminal states by analyzing ANSI-stripped output:

- **IDLE**: Agent prompt visible (legacy `[profile_name] >` or new TUI `ask a question, or describe a task`), no response content
- **PROCESSING**: No idle prompt found in output (agent is generating response)
- **COMPLETED**: Green arrow (`>`) response marker (legacy) or `▸ Credits:` marker (TUI) present + idle prompt after it
- **WAITING_USER_ANSWER**: Permission prompt visible (`Allow this action? [y/n/t]:`)
- **ERROR**: Known error indicators present (e.g., "Kiro is having trouble responding right now")

Status detection priority: no prompt → PROCESSING → ERROR → WAITING_USER_ANSWER → COMPLETED → IDLE.

The provider supports both the legacy UI prompt format and the new TUI format for all status detection and message extraction.

### Dynamic Prompt Pattern

The provider supports two prompt formats:

**Legacy UI** (used with `--legacy-ui` flag):

```
[developer] >          # Basic prompt
[developer] !>         # Prompt with pending changes
[developer] 50% >      # Prompt with progress indicator
[developer] λ >        # Prompt with lambda symbol
[developer] 50% λ >    # Combined progress and lambda
```

Pattern: `\[{agent_profile}\]\s*(?:\d+%\s*)?(?:\u03bb\s*)?!?>\s*`

**New TUI** (default in latest Kiro CLI):

```
code_supervisor · claude-opus-4.6-1m · ◔ 1%
 ask a question, or describe a task ↵
```

The new TUI idle state is detected by the `ask a question, or describe a task` pattern, and completion is detected by the `▸ Credits:` marker followed by an idle prompt. The provider launches in TUI mode by default and auto-detects which format is active.

### Message Extraction

The provider uses a dual-path extraction strategy:

**Legacy mode** (green arrow markers):
1. Strip ANSI codes from output
2. Find all green arrow (`>`) markers (response start)
3. Take the last one
4. Find the next idle prompt after it (response end)
5. Extract and clean text between them

**TUI mode** (separator + Credits markers):
1. Find the last `▸ Credits:` line (response end marker)
2. Find the last separator (`────`) before Credits (response start area)
3. Extract text between separator and Credits
4. Skip the first paragraph (user message echo)
5. Clean remaining text (ANSI, escape sequences, control characters)

The provider tries legacy extraction first; if no green arrows are found, it falls back to TUI extraction. This is backward compatible with `--legacy-ui` wrapper scripts.

### Permission Prompts

Kiro CLI shows `Allow this action? [y/n/t]:` prompts for sensitive operations (file edits, command execution). The provider detects these as `WAITING_USER_ANSWER` status. Unlike Claude Code, Kiro CLI does not have a trust folder dialog.

## Configuration

### Agent Profile (Required)

Kiro CLI always requires an agent profile. CAO passes it via:

```
kiro-cli chat --agent {profile_name}
```

The profile name determines the prompt pattern used for status detection. Built-in profiles include `developer` and `reviewer`.

### Launch Command

The provider launches using kiro-cli's default UI:

```
kiro-cli chat --agent-engine v2 --agent developer
```

The provider auto-detects whether the terminal is in legacy or TUI mode and uses the appropriate detection patterns, so both sets of patterns remain supported (a wrapper script may still put the terminal in legacy mode).

**CAO never passes `--legacy-ui` itself, and there is no legacy-UI retry on timeout.** The flag is mutually exclusive with `--agent-engine=v2` — kiro-cli exits with `Conflicting options: --legacy-ui cannot be used with --agent-engine=v2` — and on its own it implicitly selects the **v1 engine, which exposes no MCP tools to the model**. Because CAO's orchestration surface (`assign`, `handoff`, `report_outcome`, …) is delivered entirely over MCP, a v1 launch produces an agent that starts cleanly and then cannot orchestrate at all. The failure is silent: the MCP server still boots and logs `✓ cao-mcp-server loaded`, while every one of its tools is missing from the agent's tool list. A startup timeout therefore raises instead of retrying.

## Implementation Notes

- **ANSI stripping**: All pattern matching operates on ANSI-stripped output for reliability
- **Green arrow pattern**: `^>\s*` matches the start of agent responses (after ANSI stripping)
- **Generic prompt pattern**: `\x1b\[38;5;13m>\s*\x1b\[39m\s*$` matches the purple-colored prompt in raw output (used for log monitoring)
- **Error detection**: Checks for known error strings like "Kiro is having trouble responding right now"
- **Multi-format cleanup**: Extraction strips ANSI codes, escape sequences, and control characters
- **Exit command**: `/exit` via `POST /terminals/{terminal_id}/exit`

### Status Values

- `TerminalStatus.IDLE`: Ready for input
- `TerminalStatus.PROCESSING`: Working on task
- `TerminalStatus.WAITING_USER_ANSWER`: Waiting for permission confirmation
- `TerminalStatus.COMPLETED`: Task finished
- `TerminalStatus.ERROR`: Error occurred

## End-to-End Testing

The E2E test suite validates handoff, assign, and send_message flows for Kiro CLI.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Agent profile required" Error**:
   - Kiro CLI cannot be launched without an agent profile
   - Always specify `--agents` when launching: `cao launch --agents developer --provider kiro_cli`

2. **Permission Prompts Blocking**:
   - Kiro CLI shows `[y/n/t]` prompts for operations
   - The provider detects these as `WAITING_USER_ANSWER`
   - In multi-agent flows, the supervisor or user must handle these

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Verify AWS credentials
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   # Set credentials via environment
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=...
   ```

4. **Prompt Pattern Not Matching**:
   - The provider supports both legacy (`[name] >`) and new TUI (`ask a question, or describe a task`) formats
   - TUI mode is the default; the provider auto-detects which format is active
   - Check with: `kiro-cli chat --agent your_profile`
   - Do **not** add `--legacy-ui` via a wrapper script to work around a detection problem: it drops kiro to the v1 engine, which serves no MCP tools, so the agent will start but be unable to `assign`/`handoff`/`report_outcome`

5. **JSON-Only Agent Profiles (AIM-Installed)**:
   - Agents installed via AIM (Agent Install Manager) may only have `.json` profiles (e.g., `~/.kiro/agents/librarian/agent-spec.json`)
   - CAO's `load_agent_profile()` primarily scans for `.md` files
   - If the agent is not found, CAO gracefully falls back — kiro-cli resolves `.json` profiles natively
   - As a workaround, you can create a stub `.md` file alongside the `.json` profile

6. **Agent Reports "No Such Tool" for MCP Tools**:
   - Symptom: startup logs show `✓ cao-mcp-server loaded in N s`, but the agent says it has no `assign`/`handoff`/`report_outcome` tool
   - Cause: the session is running the **v1 agent engine**, which does not expose MCP tools. Almost always because `--legacy-ui` reached the command line (it implies v1), e.g. via a wrapper script
   - Check: `kiro-cli mcp list` from inside the session — `cao-mcp-server` will be absent from the enabled servers
   - Fix: remove `--legacy-ui`; CAO pins `--agent-engine v2` on its own

## kiro-cli 2.11+ Notes

Starting with kiro-cli 2.11, the TUI changed how it accepts pasted input and how
it renders the processing indicator. CAO's kiro_cli provider handles these:

- **Paste submission**: kiro 2.11 needs **two** Enter keystrokes after a
  bracketed paste to submit the message (first Enter finalizes the paste, second
  submits). The provider sets `paste_enter_count = 2` and `paste_submit_delay =
  1.0s`. Older kiro versions submitted on a single Enter.
- **Processing indicator**: kiro 2.11 replaced `"Kiro is working"` with
  `"Thinking..."` (with an optional `"(esc to cancel)"` suffix). The provider
  matches either variant in `TUI_PROCESSING_PATTERN`.
- **Idle placeholder always visible**: The `"ask a question or describe a task"`
  placeholder text remains in the raw buffer even during processing. The
  provider's Check 6 in `get_status()` requires a bordered response box (two
  separators + ≥2 content lines between them) before a bare idle-prompt match is
  treated as COMPLETED — otherwise the worker would be torn down within seconds
  of a task being sent.
- **Spinner animation floods the event bus**: kiro 2.11's TUI redraws a braille
  spinner (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧`) roughly 10 times per second while an agent is thinking.
  Each redraw is a separate FIFO write. Without coalescing, that produces
  thousands of `terminal.{id}.output` events per turn — enough to overflow the
  shared async queue and drop the worker's real state transitions along with
  the animation noise. CAO's FIFO reader batches chunks arriving within a
  50ms window into one publish (`_COALESCE_WINDOW`), reducing publish rate
  ~20x during bursts. Consumers see the same bytes in the same order; only
  the event boundaries change. If handoff/assign start hanging on a newer
  kiro release, check whether the animation frame rate increased beyond what
  50ms can absorb.

If you upgrade kiro-cli and handoffs stop working (worker gets killed
prematurely, or the task sits unsent in the input box), check whether the
paste-submit behavior or processing-indicator text changed in the new version
and update the provider constants accordingly.
