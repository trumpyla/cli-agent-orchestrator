# AG-UI event stream

CAO exposes its normalized fleet events as an
[AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui) typed-event stream over
Server-Sent Events at `GET /agui/v1/stream`. Any AG-UI-compatible client —
CopilotKit apps, the [AG-UI Dojo](https://docs.ag-ui.com/quickstart/applications),
or a plain `EventSource` — renders a live CAO fleet with no CAO-specific adapter
code. A producer endpoint, `POST /agui/v1/emit_ui`, lets agents author
allow-listed **generative UI** onto the same stream.

The surface is **default-off** and metadata-only (message bodies are never on
the wire).

## Enabling the AG-UI surface

`/agui/v1/stream` and `/agui/v1/emit_ui` return `404` unless the surface is
enabled:

```sh
export CAO_AGUI_ENABLED=true      # dedicated AG-UI flag
# (or CAO_MCP_APPS_ENABLED=true, which also enables it — both surfaces read the
#  same in-process event source with the same privacy boundary)
```

With neither flag set the endpoints are absent and the server is byte-identical
to a build without the feature.

## The stream

`GET /agui/v1/stream` maps CAO's six normalized event primitives onto AG-UI
typed events:

| CAO primitive | AG-UI event(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| session / terminal launch | `RUN_STARTED` / `STEP_STARTED` | |
| completion | `RUN_FINISHED` / `STEP_FINISHED` | Also triggers synthesized `TOOL_CALL_END` for open receivers |
| handoff (`orchestration_type=handoff\|assign`) | `TOOL_CALL_START` | Agent-to-agent task delegation [1] |
| handoff (`orchestration_type=send_message` or absent) | `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` (metadata only) | Simple message dispatch |
| a2a_delegation | `TOOL_CALL_START` | Cross-agent A2A task; closer also synthesizes `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` |
| file modification | `STATE_DELTA` (RFC 6902) against a fleet `STATE_SNAPSHOT` | |
| error | `RUN_ERROR` | |
| agent-authored UI | `GENERATIVE_UI` | |

[1] **L1 Cleanup A (TOOL_CALL lifecycle):** Handoff records with
`orchestration_type` of `handoff` or `assign` now map to `TOOL_CALL_START`
(previously all handoffs mapped to `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`). The
`ToolCallLifecycleTracker` correlates these opens with receiver terminal
completions and synthesizes exactly one `TOOL_CALL_END` per open. For
`a2a_delegation` opens, a `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` is also synthesized before the
`TOOL_CALL_END`. This ensures AG-UI clients see a well-formed tool-call
lifecycle (open/result/end) rather than orphaned starts.

On connect the server emits a full `STATE_SNAPSHOT` so any client hydrates its
projection, then keeps it current with minimal RFC 6902 `STATE_DELTA` patches
after each fleet change.

## Consuming it

```sh
curl -N http://localhost:9889/agui/v1/stream
```

For a browser client on another origin, add that origin to CORS via
`CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated; appended to the localhost defaults):

```sh
export CAO_AGUI_ENABLED=true
export CAO_CORS_ORIGINS="https://dashboard.example.com"
uv run cao-server
```

## Auth (when CAO has Auth0 enabled)

If CAO runs with `AUTH0_DOMAIN` set, `/agui/v1/stream` requires a `cao:read`
JWT. Native `EventSource` can't send an `Authorization:` header, so the token
travels as the `?access_token=<JWT>` query parameter:

```
https://dashboard.example.com/?access_token=eyJhbGc...
```

**Keep these tokens short-lived.** A query-string credential can surface where
an `Authorization` header never would (browser history, proxy logs, `Referer`
headers) and stays replayable until `exp`. CAO scrubs `access_token` (and,
pre-emptively, `ticket`) values from its own access log, but that doesn't cover
intermediaries — so mint short-TTL tokens (minutes, not hours). A short-lived
single-use ticket handshake (`POST /agui/v1/ticket` with header auth →
`?ticket=`) is a follow-up.

## Connection resilience

A client that drops the connection resumes **without a gap** by one of two
cursors:

- **`Last-Event-ID` (automatic).** Every event frame carries an `id:` cursor, so
  a native browser `EventSource` resends the last id it saw as the
  `Last-Event-ID` request header on its automatic reconnect. The server replays
  the buffered records **after that id** before the live stream — no client code
  required.
- **`?since=<last event timestamp>` (explicit).** A non-`EventSource` client (or
  one resuming across a fresh connection) can pass an ISO-8601 lower bound to
  replay buffered events after that time.

`?since=` takes precedence when both are supplied. Either way the server
registers the live subscription **before** replaying history, then drains both
with event-id deduplication, so events published during the reconnect handoff
are neither lost nor double-delivered. Pair this with a capped exponential
backoff on the client.

**Overflow is a gap *signal*, not a silent drop.** Each subscriber has a bounded
queue so one slow client can never back-pressure the orchestration core. If that
queue fills, the AG-UI stream does **not** quietly drop events on an open
connection — it marks the overflow and **closes the stream**. The browser then
reconnects automatically and the dropped records are replayed exactly once via
`Last-Event-ID` (above). The durable record behind the replay is the in-process
ring buffer (`event_log_service`). (The MCP-Apps `/events` stream keeps its
legacy drop-on-slow behaviour and backfills via `cao_fetch_history`.)

## Replay contract (full specification)

The replay mechanism is deterministic and designed for safe, idempotent reconnects:

### Cursor precedence

1. **`?since=<ISO-8601>`** -- explicit timestamp lower bound. Must be a valid
   ISO-8601 string; malformed values produce HTTP 400 before any streaming starts.
2. **`Last-Event-ID` header** -- native EventSource automatic cursor. Used only
   when `?since=` is absent.
3. **Neither** -- no replay; only the live stream is emitted.

### Validation

The `?since=` parameter is validated as ISO-8601 using `datetime.fromisoformat()`
**before** the streaming response begins. Invalid values return `400 Bad Request`
with a descriptive error. This prevents malformed cursors from being silently
swallowed inside the failure-isolated replay block.

### Over-delivery and deduplication (Seen-Set Dedup)

The live subscription is registered **before** history replay begins. This means
events published during the replay-to-live handoff are buffered in the subscriber
queue. The stream maintains a `replayed_ids` set to deduplicate the overlap:
events that appear in both the replay batch and the live queue are emitted only
once (from replay). This guarantees neither gaps nor duplicates.

### Snapshot ordering

On every connection (fresh or reconnect), the server emits a full
`STATE_SNAPSHOT` after the replay batch and before the first live `STATE_DELTA`.
A client must receive the snapshot to hydrate its projection before it can
correctly apply RFC-6902 patches.

### Tool-call lifecycle across reconnects

The `ToolCallLifecycleTracker` is instantiated per-connection. On reconnect with
replay, the tracker processes replayed records first (rebuilding its open-call
map), then continues with live events. Because the tracker is deterministic
(same inputs produce same outputs), a replay produces the same synthesized frames
as the original stream -- no duplicate closers, no orphan frames.

### CAO extension status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `?since=` ISO-8601 validation | Shipped | 400 on malformed |
| `Last-Event-ID` replay | Shipped | Native EventSource compatible |
| Seen-Set dedup | Shipped | Zero duplicates on reconnect |
| Overflow-as-gap signal | Shipped | Stream closes; client reconnects |
| `TOOL_CALL_END` lifecycle synthesis | Shipped | Deterministic under replay |
| Short-lived ticket handshake | Follow-up | `POST /agui/v1/ticket` TBD |

## Generative UI

Any agent in the fleet — regardless of provider — can author a UI intent and
have it rendered uniformly by any AG-UI client. The safety model is what makes
that shippable over *untrusted* agents: an agent may only emit a **closed
allow-list of named components with JSON props** — no HTML, no script, no
`eval`, no iframe. An off-list component is **refused, never rendered**.

**Wire path.** An agent calls the `emit_ui` MCP tool (or
`POST /agui/v1/emit_ui`) → the intent rides a CAO event as a `ui` block
(`{component, props}`) → the AG-UI adapter maps it to a typed `GENERATIVE_UI`
frame → `GET /agui/v1/stream` emits it → any AG-UI client renders it.

**Server-side validation** (`services/agui_stream.py`): the closed allow-list
`GENERATIVE_UI_COMPONENTS = {approval_card, choice_prompt, diff_summary,
progress, metric, agent_card}`; unknown components are refused (mapped to `RAW`
with `rejected_component`); props must be JSON-serializable and are size-bounded
(8 KB), degrading safely. `POST /agui/v1/emit_ui` rejects off-list components and
oversized/non-serializable props with `400` before anything reaches the bus.

### Safety model

| Threat | Mitigation | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Agent emits arbitrary HTML/script | No HTML on the wire — only named components + JSON props | `TestGenerativeUI` |
| Agent names an off-list component (e.g. `iframe`) | Refused server-side (→ RAW / 400) | `test_off_list_component_is_refused` |
| Agent floods the bus with a huge payload | Props capped at 8 KB → `{_truncated: true}` | `test_oversized_props_are_truncated` |
| Non-serializable props | Degrade to `{}` | `test_non_serializable_props_degrade_to_empty` |
| Message-body leakage | Bodies never in the props path (metadata-only contract) | privacy tests |

A conformant client SHOULD mirror the allow-list as defense in depth and render
each component from JSON props only (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no `eval`),
falling back to an inert placeholder for anything unknown.

### Live proof

[`examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-dashboard/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-dashboard) is a credentials-free,
runnable demonstration: `run.sh` starts a `cao-server` with the surface enabled
and `showcase.sh` drives all six allow-listed components plus an off-list
refusal through `emit_ui`, gating on the `GENERATIVE_UI` frames actually
arriving on the live SSE stream (so it doubles as a deployment smoke test). Teach
an agent the component vocabulary with the bundled
[`agui-author`](../skills/agui-author/SKILL.md) skill.

A **stock browser client** rendering the stream — the dependency-free
[`examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-eventsource-viewer/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-eventsource-viewer) — is the
adapter-level proof. Its demo GIF is **generated by the build** (shift-left): the
recorder drives the six components + the off-list refusal and asserts each renders
before exporting the GIF, so CI fails if the stream→component contract drifts.

## Two-plane model

CAO exposes its AG-UI surface through two complementary planes that differ in
wire dialect, consumer shape, and intended use:

### Ambient dialect (GET /agui/v1/stream)

The **ambient plane** is the `GET /agui/v1/stream` SSE endpoint. It speaks
CAO's own AG-UI dialect: `event:` + `data:` frames with UPPER_SNAKE event types
(`STATE_SNAPSHOT`, `STATE_DELTA`, `STEP_STARTED`, `GENERATIVE_UI`, etc.) and an
`id:` cursor for replay. Any `EventSource`-compatible client (browser-native or
library-based) connects, hydrates from the initial `STATE_SNAPSHOT`, then folds
live frames into its projection.

This plane is optimized for long-lived dashboard consumers and the L2 construct
library. No request body is required; the client is a pure observer. Replay is
`Last-Event-ID`-based (browser-automatic) or `?since=`-based (explicit).

### Stock run plane (POST /agui/v1/run)

The **run plane** is the `POST /agui/v1/run` endpoint. It speaks the stock
[ag-ui-protocol](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui) wire dialect:
`data:`-only JSON frames with a `type` field, produced by the official
`EventEncoder`. Official run-lifecycle fields retain the SDK's camelCase wire
aliases; CAO correlation fields on extended projection events retain the
snake_case contract that predates the SDK alias convention:

| Event family | Correlation keys | Event-specific keys |
|---|---|---|
| Official `RUN_STARTED`, `RUN_FINISHED` | `threadId`, `runId` | SDK-defined |
| CAO `RUN_ERROR`, `STATE_SNAPSHOT`, `STATE_DELTA`, `CUSTOM` | `thread_id`, `run_id` | SDK-defined |
| CAO `STEP_STARTED`, `STEP_FINISHED` | `thread_id`, `run_id`, `step_id` | `stepName` |
| CAO `TOOL_CALL_START`, `TOOL_CALL_END` | `thread_id`, `run_id` | `toolCallId`; starts also include `toolCallName` |

The distinction is intentional and covered by exact serialization tests. Stock
clients continue to receive SDK event types and payload shapes, while existing
CAO consumers do not lose their shipped correlation keys.

A client POSTs a `RunAgentInput` (threadId, runId, optional resume[]) and
receives a lifecycle-legal stream: `RUN_STARTED` then `STATE_SNAPSHOT` then live
projection frames (`STATE_DELTA`, `STEP_STARTED/FINISHED`, `TOOL_CALL_START/END`,
`CUSTOM`) then `RUN_FINISHED`. If open approval interrupts exist, the stream
closes with a `RUN_FINISHED` whose outcome is `{type: "interrupt", interrupts: [...]}`,
and the client re-POSTs with a `resume[]` array to resolve them.

The run plane requires the `[agui]` optional extra (`ag-ui-protocol` package).
Without it the endpoint returns HTTP 501.

### Choosing a plane

| Use case | Plane | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Long-lived supervisory dashboard | Ambient | EventSource auto-reconnect, replay, no request body |
| CopilotKit / AG-UI Dojo integration | Run | Stock wire dialect, interrupt/resume lifecycle |
| L2 construct composition (Python) | Ambient | AguiStreamReader + fold constructs |
| Raw HTTP client proving connectivity | Run | Single POST, verifiable frame output |
| CI smoke tests | Either | Both exit non-zero on unmet preconditions |

---

## L2 construct library

The `services/agui/` package provides fold-based constructs that compose on top
of the ambient stream. Each construct consumes AG-UI frames (via `handle_frame`)
and derives a `projection()` view without I/O.

### Foundation

| Class | Role |
|---|---|
| `AguiConstruct` | Abstract base: `handle_frame`, `projection`, `emit` (validated) |
| `UiEmitter` / `RecordingUiEmitter` / `InProcessUiEmitter` / `HttpUiEmitter` | Emitter family (protocol + implementations) |
| `AguiStreamReader` | `requests`-based SSE reader yielding `(event_id, agui_type, data)` tuples |
| `ToolCallLifecycleTracker` | Correlates TOOL_CALL opens with terminal completions |
| `apply_json_patch_strict` | Pure RFC-6902 subset (add/remove/replace), never mutates inputs |

### Fold-based constructs

#### SupervisorDashboardStream

Folds `STATE_SNAPSHOT` and `STATE_DELTA` frames to maintain a local copy of the
fleet topology. Derives:

- `hierarchy()`: session-name keyed dict with terminal lists and counts
- `supervisor_snapshot()`: active sessions, provider distribution, waiting terminals, rollup counters

**Frames folded:** STATE_SNAPSHOT, STATE_DELTA, STEP_STARTED/FINISHED,
RUN_STARTED/FINISHED, TOOL_CALL_START/END/RESULT (rollup counters).

**Seen-Set Dedup:** id-bearing frames already processed are skipped; state
frames (event_id=None) are always folded.

#### MultiAgentSessionTimeline

Tracks delegations and messages as an ordered timeline:

- `TOOL_CALL_START` opens a delegation entry (keyed by tool_call_id)
- `TOOL_CALL_END`/`TOOL_CALL_RESULT` closes matching entries
- `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` appends message entries (metadata only, no body)

**Projection:** `entries()` returns `TimelineEntry` list sorted by `(started_at, id)`.

**Retention cap:** configurable (default 1000), evicts oldest first.

#### CrossProviderStateSync

Maintains a shared state view by folding snapshots/deltas:

- `shared_state()`: the current state (or None before first snapshot)
- `providers_seen()`: sorted list of unique providers from terminals
- `converges_with(authoritative)`: deep-equality check against a reference

Useful for verifying that a client-side projection has converged with the
server's authoritative state.

#### AgentHandoffWithApproval

Human-in-the-loop approval lifecycle:

- `on_provider_waiting(terminal_id, provider, raw_prompt)`: classifies the
  prompt via `classify_reason` and creates an `Interrupt` record
- `resume(interrupt_id, decision, edited_text)`: lock-guarded exactly-once
  resolution with per-provider answer translation
- `expire(terminal_id)`: zero-keystroke expiration on state transition
- `pending()`: list of unresolved interrupts

**Interrupt options** derive from the classified reason (permission_request gets
approve/deny/edit; trust_prompt gets approve/deny).

### Subclass extension points

All constructs expose their state through `projection()` (JSON-serializable dict).
Subclasses can:

1. Override `handle_frame` to fold additional frame types
2. Call `self.emit(component, props)` to author generative-UI intents (validated
   against the allow-list and 8 KB size bound)
3. Call `self.assert_no_body(data)` to enforce the metadata-only contract
4. Access `self._emitter` for custom transport needs

### Composition pattern

```python
from cli_agent_orchestrator.services.agui import (
    AguiStreamReader,
    RecordingUiEmitter,
    SupervisorDashboardStream,
)

reader = AguiStreamReader("http://localhost:9889")
emitter = RecordingUiEmitter()
dashboard = SupervisorDashboardStream(emitter)

for event_id, agui_type, data in reader.frames():
    dashboard.handle_frame(agui_type, data, event_id)

print(dashboard.hierarchy())
print(dashboard.supervisor_snapshot())
```

### Runnable examples

Each construct has a runnable example in `examples/`:

- [`agui-supervisor-dashboard/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-supervisor-dashboard/) - SupervisorDashboardStream composition
- [`agui-session-timeline/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-session-timeline/) - MultiAgentSessionTimeline delegation tracking
- [`agui-handoff-approval/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-handoff-approval/) - Human-in-the-loop approval (CI + live procedure)
- [`agui-cross-provider-sync/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-cross-provider-sync/) - CrossProviderStateSync convergence
- [`agui-stock-client-live/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-stock-client-live/) - Stock AG-UI run plane (POST /agui/v1/run)

### Shift-left video evidence (per feature)

Each new L2 construct ships a **gated** demo recording — proof-of-work, not
decoration. The recorder in
[`examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-construct-demos/tools/`](../examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-construct-demos/tools/)
runs the construct's own asserting example (the `run.sh` above, in
offline/synthetic mode — no live provider, network, or secrets), and **only**
produces a GIF if the example exits `0` and prints its `PASS` marker. If a
construct regresses, the example exits non-zero, the recorder fails, and CI goes
red (see the `AG-UI construct demos (shift-left recordings)` job) — so a broken
construct cannot yield a green recording. Regenerate locally with:

```sh
cd examples/ag-ui/ag-ui-construct-demos/tools
npm ci && npm run playwright:install && npm run record   # ONLY=<slug> for one
```

The GIFs are committed under [`docs/media/`](media/) and re-generated + uploaded
as CI artifacts (`agui-construct-demos`) on every run.

**SupervisorDashboardStream** — folds `STATE_SNAPSHOT`/`STATE_DELTA` into a live
fleet view (active sessions, provider distribution, waiting terminals):

**MultiAgentSessionTimeline** — reconstructs the delegation + message timeline
from tool-call frames and closes entries on `TOOL_CALL_END`/`RESULT`:

![MultiAgentSessionTimeline example asserting delegation tracking](media/ag-ui-session-timeline-demo.gif)

**AgentHandoffWithApproval** — human-in-the-loop lifecycle: classify the prompt,
raise an interrupt, resume exactly-once (idempotent), and expire on transition:

![AgentHandoffWithApproval example asserting the approval lifecycle](media/ag-ui-handoff-approval-demo.gif)

**CrossProviderStateSync** — convergent shared state across `claude_code`,
`kiro_cli`, and `codex`, verified with `converges_with()` before and after a delta:

## Privacy boundary

`/agui/v1/stream` redacts message bodies (same contract as the SSE bus and the
in-host MCP Apps iframe). `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` events carry metadata (sender,
receiver, orchestration_type) but never the message text.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection shows an error** — check that `CAO_AGUI_ENABLED` is set (else the
endpoint 404s) and, for a cross-origin browser client, that the origin is allowed
via `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` (exact scheme + host + port), then restart CAO.

**401 on connect with auth enabled** — token missing or expired. Get a fresh
`cao:read` token and pass it via `?access_token=`.

**Events stop after a proxy idle timeout** — reconnect with backoff. A native
`EventSource` resumes automatically via `Last-Event-ID`; other clients resume
via `?since=`. No state is lost.
