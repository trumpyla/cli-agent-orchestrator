"""Conditional shape — shim-based (M1, FR-7.1).

Branches on a simple author-controlled condition and runs a DIFFERENT step
depending on which branch is taken — proving only the taken branch's
``run_step`` call executes, never both.

The branch condition is a plain in-script constant (NOT read from the
environment or an external input) — U4's constructed spawn env carries only
the fixed identity allowlist (``CAO_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID``/``GENERATION``/
``CAO_API_BASE_URL``/``PATH``/``HOME``), so a script's own control flow must
be deterministic from its own source, not from ambient environment state
(the authoring guide's determinism obligation). Edit ``IS_URGENT`` below to
exercise the other branch.

Run standalone by copying it into the workflows directory and running it by its
stem — ``cao workflow run`` resolves a bare name, and rejects a path outside
that directory::

    cp docs/examples/conditional_example.py ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/
    cao workflow validate ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/conditional_example.py
    cao workflow run conditional_example
