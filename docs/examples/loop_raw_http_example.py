"""Loop shape — raw HTTP, NO shim (Q2=A shim-optionality proof, FR-6.1).

Demonstrates that the shim is a convenience, not a requirement: this script
reads the SAME three identity env vars ``cao workflow run`` injects and posts
to ``/terminals/run-step`` with stdlib ``urllib`` directly, with no
``cao_workflow`` import at all. Compare against ``loop_example.py`` — same
shape, same env contract, no shim.

Run standalone by copying it into the workflows directory and running it by its
stem — ``cao workflow run`` resolves a bare name, and rejects a path outside
that directory::

    cp docs/examples/loop_raw_http_example.py ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/
    cao workflow validate ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/workflows/loop_raw_http_example.py
    cao workflow run loop_raw_http_example
