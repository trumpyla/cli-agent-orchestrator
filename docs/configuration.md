# Configuration

CAO stores user configuration in a single file, `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/settings.json`. This consolidates what used to be two separate files (`settings.json` and `config.json`) into one unified schema, resolved through one precedence chain:

```
CLI flag  >  CAO_* environment variable  >  settings.json  >  built-in default
```

`ConfigService` (`services/config_service.py`) is the single reader/writer behind this precedence chain. `agents`, `skills`, `server`, `memory`, `terminal`, and `apps` are fully wired: setting any of their keys in `settings.json` (or the mapped `CAO_*` env var) has a real runtime effect. `network` and `auth` are schema-only for now — see the "env-var only" callouts in those sections below and in the env-var reference.

> `.env` file handling (`utils/env.py`, forwarded provider env vars) is a separate, out-of-scope surface — unaffected by this doc.

Every top-level key is optional — omit any section/key you don't want to override; `ConfigService` fills in built-in defaults.

## `cao config` CLI

```bash
cao config get terminal.backend       # resolved value (env/file/default applied)
cao config set terminal.backend herdr # persist to settings.json
cao config list                       # every known key, resolved
cao config path                       # absolute path to settings.json
```

## Per-user `cao-server` service

Install one login-started, crash-resilient `cao-server` for the current user:

```bash
scripts/cao-service.sh install
scripts/cao-service.sh status
```

The controller uses a LaunchAgent on macOS and `systemd --user` on Linux. It
copies its runtime to `~/.local/libexec/cao-service`, so later service starts do
not depend on the repository that performed the installation. State and macOS
logs live under `~/.local/state/cao`.

Lifecycle commands are safe to repeat:

```bash
scripts/cao-service.sh ensure
scripts/cao-service.sh start
scripts/cao-service.sh restart
scripts/cao-service.sh stop
scripts/cao-service.sh uninstall
```

`ensure` installs when absent, starts when stopped, and does nothing when the
managed service is healthy. The controller serializes lifecycle operations and
refuses to start when another process owns port 9889. It never kills or adopts
an unmanaged process. `uninstall` removes only the native definition and copied
controller runtime; it preserves user configuration and state logs.

Optional service-only environment overrides may be placed in
`~/.config/cao/service.env`. The file is sourced as shell syntax by the user's
service process, so only put trusted content in it and make it private:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.config/cao/service.env
scripts/cao-service.sh restart
```

The runner rejects a symlink, a different owner, or any mode other than 600. It
never prints environment values. Installation captures the exact
`cao-server` executable on `PATH`; rerun `install` after changing that
executable path. After upgrading CAO in place, use `restart` so the managed
process loads the new version. See [Updating CAO](updating.md#after-updating).

For native diagnostics:

```bash
# macOS
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.artagon.cao-server"
tail -n 100 ~/.local/state/cao/stderr.log

# Linux
systemctl --user status cao-server.service
journalctl --user -u cao-server.service
```

The managed server exposes CAO Ops over Streamable HTTP at
`http://127.0.0.1:9889/mcp/ops`. This does not replace the identity-bearing
`cao-mcp-server`: agent profiles still launch that MCP server over stdio so CAO
can inject `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` for the session. Repository profiles resolve from
each session's working directory.

The service controller does not rewrite agent profiles. A user-store profile
that explicitly runs `uvx --from git+...@COMMIT cao-mcp-server` remains pinned
to that commit until the profile is regenerated or reinstalled separately.
Current repository profiles should declare the bare `cao-mcp-server` command;
CAO resolves it to the launcher in the active installation at terminal launch.

## Sections

### Agents (`agents`)

CAO discovers agent profiles by scanning multiple directories, in this order (first match wins):

1. **Local store** — `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-store/`
2. **Provider-specific directories** — `agents.dirs`, keyed by provider
3. **Repository profiles** — nearest `.cao/agents/` up to the current Git worktree root
4. **Extra custom directories** — `agents.extra_dirs`
5. **Built-in store** — bundled with the CAO package

The repository convention is automatic: a fresh clone can commit portable
profiles under `.cao/agents/` without adding a machine-specific absolute path
to user settings. User-configured directories remain available for profiles
shared across repositories.

| Key | Provider | Default Path |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `kiro_cli` | Kiro CLI | `~/.kiro/agents` |
| `claude_code` | Claude Code | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-store` |
| `codex` | Codex | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-store` |
| `cao_installed` | CAO Installed | `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-context` |

Override via REST API, Web UI Settings page, `cao config set agents.dirs.<provider> <path>`, or editing `settings.json` directly. Only specified providers are updated; others keep their defaults.

`agents.disabled_dirs` lists configured directories (defaults or extras) the user has toggled **off**: a disabled directory stays listed in Settings but is skipped when scanning for and loading agent profiles, so its profiles leave the active set without removing the path (GH #280/#281). Only paths that match a configured directory are accepted; entries are validated with the same path normalization the scanner uses (`~`, trailing slashes, and symlinks all match). Manage it via the Web UI Settings toggles, `cao config set agents.disabled_dirs '[...]'`, or `settings.json`.

`agents.roles` defines custom [role](../CODEBASE.md) → `allowedTools` bundles, layered on top of the built-in `supervisor` / `reviewer` / `developer` roles.

### Skills (`skills`)

Skills (loaded on demand via the `load_skill` MCP tool) are discovered from, in order:

1. **Global skill store** — `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/skills/`
2. **User extra directories** — `skills.extra_dirs` in the user settings file
3. **Repository extra directories** — `skills.extra_dirs` in the nearest
   `.cao/settings.json`

`skills.extra_dirs` lets you keep a project's skills in the project repo (e.g. `<repo>/.cao/skills`) and register the directory instead of copying/symlinking each skill into the global store.
Repository entries may use `~`; relative entries are resolved from the
repository root. They may also be one exact `${ENV_NAME}` reference for a
machine-local skill directory. Missing or malformed references fail closed
without logging the variable name or resolved value. Invalid repository
settings fail closed, and discovery stops at the first Git worktree root.

For a launched terminal, CAO records its assigned working directory and uses
that same repository context for both the advertised skill catalog and later
`load_skill` calls. Provider restoration after a server restart preserves this
context; callers identify the terminal and never submit an arbitrary skill
search path.

### Server (`server`)

Timeouts and buffer sizes used by the CAO runtime. All values have safe defaults — only override if you experience timeouts or queue overflows.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `mcp_request_timeout` | `30` | Seconds to wait for HTTP calls between the MCP server process and the CAO API. |
| `event_bus_max_queue_size` | `1024` | Max events buffered per subscriber queue in the internal event bus. |
| `provider_init_timeout` | `60` | Seconds to wait for a CLI agent to reach IDLE. Also the hard outer cap on total time a startup-prompt handler (Claude Code, Kimi, Antigravity) may run. Overridable per-profile via `provider_init_timeout` in the agent profile — see [Agent Profile Format](agent-profile.md#optional-fields). |
| `startup_prompt_handler_timeout` | `20` | Idle gap, in seconds, between consecutive startup prompts (e.g. workspace trust / bypass dialogs, Kimi's upgrade dialog, Antigravity's trust/survey dialogs). The handler polls and resets this timer each time it answers a prompt; it only starts counting once the FIRST prompt has been handled, so a first dialog arriving later than this value (e.g. a cold/containerized start) is still caught — before any prompt is seen, only `provider_init_timeout` bounds the wait. Once at least one prompt has been handled, the handler exits after this many seconds pass with no further prompt. |

### Memory (`memory`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the memory subsystem. |
| `compile_mode` | `"llm"` | `llm` or `append`. `append` skips the LLM wiki-compiler entirely. |
| `flush_threshold` | `0.85` | Context-usage fraction that triggers a memory flush. |
| `compile_timeout_s` | `120.0` | Wall-clock timeout for the wiki compile call. |

For a low-token append-only memory mode:

```bash
cao config set memory.compile_mode append
```

### Completed-session cleanup (`cleanup`)

Irreversible completed-session cleanup is default-off and Herdr-only. The
daemon hot-reloads this section before every delayed, bounded sweep:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `completed_sessions_enabled` | `false` | Enables future completed-session sweeps. |
| `completed_session_grace_s` | `900` | Minimum seconds since the newest terminal activity; minimum 60. |
| `sweep_interval_s` | `300` | Delay before the first and later sweeps; minimum 30. |
| `max_sessions_per_sweep` | `5` | Oldest-first deletion bound, 1–50. |
| `preserve_patterns` | `[]` | Case-sensitive glob patterns for complete CAO session labels. |

See [Runtime resource cleanup](runtime-resource-cleanup.md) for stable-ID
revalidation, pending-inbox protection, teardown ordering, observability,
backup/rollback steps, and the irreversible-delete warning.

### Terminal backend (`terminal`)

CAO's default backend is [tmux](tmux.md). [herdr](https://herdr.dev/) is an experimental, opt-in alternative — a terminal-native agent runtime that exposes real-time status events instead of requiring CAO to poll and pattern-match terminal output.

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "backend": "herdr",
    "herdr_session": "my-session"
  }
}
```

- `backend`: `"tmux"` (default) or `"herdr"` [EXPERIMENTAL].
- `herdr_session`: the herdr session name to connect to (default `"cao"`).

Select a backend for a single run without touching `settings.json`:

```bash
cao-server --terminal herdr
```

`--terminal` (CLI flag) beats `CAO_TERMINAL_BACKEND` (env var) beats `terminal.backend` (file) beats the `"tmux"` default — the standard precedence chain. See [herdr.md](herdr.md) for herdr-specific setup, viewing/attaching, and troubleshooting.

### MCP Apps (`apps`)

Default-off. See [../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/ext_apps/apps.py](../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/ext_apps/apps.py) for the `ui://cao/*` MCP App resource surface this gates.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enables the MCP Apps surface (dashboard/agent/event-stream views + app tools + topology widget). |
| `static_dir` | `null` | Override for the built `apps_static/` directory (packaged/dev-tree locations are tried automatically otherwise). |

### Network (`network`) — env-var only

> **`network.*` keys in `settings.json` are schema-only and have no runtime effect yet.** `constants.py` builds `CORS_ORIGINS` / `ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` as module-level lists at import time, and Starlette's CORS/TrustedHost middleware are instantiated once at server startup holding a reference to those exact list objects (`add_local_cors_origins` depends on this reference semantics). Only the `CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` / `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` / `CAO_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` env vars are read — directly in `constants.py`, not through `ConfigService`. Routing these through the unified config would require either a live-invalidation path for the middleware's list references or restructuring how the middleware is wired; both are out of scope for this PR.

`cao-server` is a local-only service by default. These env vars **extend** (not replace) the loopback-only built-in defaults, so loopback access is preserved even when set.

| Env var | Extends | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (Host header allowlist for `TrustedHostMiddleware`) | Fronting cao-server with a reverse proxy at a non-localhost hostname. |
| `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` | `CORS_ORIGINS` (browser origins permitted by CORS) | Serving the web UI from a non-default port or origin. |
| `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` | `WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` (client IPs permitted to attach to the PTY WebSocket) | Running `cao-server` inside Docker (host browser arrives via a bridge IP). |

> **Security note:** the WebSocket PTY endpoint is unauthenticated. Only add client IPs you actually trust to `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` — anyone reaching the listener at one of those IPs gets full PTY access to running agent terminals.

### Auth (`auth`) — env-var only

> **`auth.*` keys in `settings.json` are schema-only and have no runtime effect yet.** `security/auth.py` is the actual authentication *enforcement* boundary (not a UX gate) and is deliberately kept on direct `os.getenv` reads in this PR, to avoid changing security-critical resolution behavior. Only the env vars below are honored.

Default-off OAuth 2.1 auth core; see [security/auth.py](../src/cli_agent_orchestrator/security/auth.py). Auth activates only when `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` (or `AUTH0_DOMAIN`) is set.

| Env var | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` | Generic IdP JWKS endpoint. |
| `CAO_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | Expected token audience. |
| `CAO_AUTH_ISSUER` | Issuer advertised by the RFC 9728 PRM endpoint. |

### Logging (`logging`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `level` | `"INFO"` | Log level for the CAO server log file. |

## Environment variable reference

### Wired through ConfigService

Every `CAO_*` variable below maps 1:1 to a `settings.json` key and is resolved through the standard precedence chain — the env var beats the file, and both lose to an explicit CLI flag where one exists. Setting either the env var or the `settings.json` key has a real runtime effect.

| Env var | Config path | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `CAO_TERMINAL_BACKEND` | `terminal.backend` | str |
| `CAO_HERDR_SESSION` | `terminal.herdr_session` | str |
| `CAO_MCP_APPS_ENABLED` | `apps.enabled` | bool |
| `CAO_MCP_APPS_STATIC_DIR` | `apps.static_dir` | str |
| `CAO_LOG_LEVEL` | `logging.level` | str |
| `CAO_MEMORY_ENABLED` | `memory.enabled` | bool |
| `CAO_MEMORY_COMPILE_MODE` | `memory.compile_mode` | str (`llm`/`append`) |
| `CAO_MEMORY_FLUSH_THRESHOLD` | `memory.flush_threshold` | float |
| `CAO_MEMORY_COMPILE_TIMEOUT_S` | `memory.compile_timeout_s` | float |
| `CAO_CLEANUP_COMPLETED_SESSIONS_ENABLED` | `cleanup.completed_sessions_enabled` | bool |
| `CAO_MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `server.mcp_request_timeout` | int |
| `CAO_EVENT_BUS_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` | `server.event_bus_max_queue_size` | int |
| `CAO_PROVIDER_INIT_TIMEOUT` | `server.provider_init_timeout` | int |
| `CAO_STARTUP_PROMPT_HANDLER_TIMEOUT` | `server.startup_prompt_handler_timeout` | int |

The full table lives in `ConfigService.ENV_REGISTRY` (`services/config_service.py`) — the source of truth this doc mirrors.

### Env-var only (settings.json value not yet honored)

These map to `network.*` / `auth.*` schema paths for documentation purposes, but only the env var is actually read — see the "env-var only" notes in the [Network](#network-network--env-var-only) and [Auth](#auth-auth--env-var-only) sections above for why.

| Env var | Config path | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` | `auth.jwks_uri` | str |
| `CAO_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | `auth.audience` | str |
| `CAO_AUTH_ISSUER` | `auth.issuer` | str |
| `CAO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `network.allowed_hosts` | comma-separated list |
| `CAO_CORS_ORIGINS` | `network.cors_origins` | comma-separated list |
| `CAO_WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` | `network.ws_allowed_clients` | comma-separated list |

### Not yet routed through ConfigService

A number of other `CAO_*` variables (runtime/process-identity vars like `CAO_TERMINAL_ID`, `CAO_SESSION_NAME`, `CAO_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID`; provider-tuning vars like `CAO_HERMES_*`, `CAO_AGENTS_DIR`, `CAO_API_HOST`/`CAO_API_PORT`, `CAO_PYTE_STATUS`, `CAO_EAGER_INBOX_DELIVERY`; and `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`) are still read ad hoc via `os.getenv` at their call sites, mostly in `constants.py`, `mcp_server/server.py`, `security/auth.py`, and the `providers/*` modules. These were deliberately left out of this pass to keep the diff scoped to the two surfaces issue #357 named explicitly (`settings.json` + `config.json`); folding them into the registry is a natural follow-up but not required for config unification.

The pipe-pane liveness watchdog (issue #388, `services/fifo_reader.py`) adds six more of these ad-hoc vars, read directly via `_env_int`/`_env_float` in `constants.py` rather than through `ConfigService` — they have no `settings.json` mapping like the rows in the table above:

| Env var | Default | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_S` | `4.0` | float | How often the watchdog compares live pane content against FIFO delivery, per enrolled terminal. |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_TAIL_LINES` | `80` | int | Lines of live pane content compared each check (`capture-pane` tail size). |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_STALL_CHECKS` | `2` | int | Consecutive diverging checks required before re-arming a stalled forwarder. |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_REARM_FAILURES` | `5` | int | Consecutive failed re-arm attempts before the watchdog gives up on a terminal. |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_COLD_START_GRACE_S` | `3.0` | float | Grace period after a terminal is registered before a FIFO that has never delivered a single byte is treated as a cold-start stall (harness-control#93) instead of "still booting". |
| `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_COLD_START_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | int | Consecutive cold-start re-arm attempts (rearm() succeeded but the pipe still never delivered) before the watchdog gives up on a terminal — a separate failure class and counter from `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_REARM_FAILURES`, which only counts rearm() raising. |

## Migrating from the old two-file setup

Previously, `terminal_backend` / `herdr_session` lived in a separate `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/config.json`, read inline by `backends/factory.py`. On first read after upgrading, if `config.json` exists and `settings.json` has no `terminal` section yet, `ConfigService` copies `terminal_backend` → `terminal.backend` and `herdr_session` → `terminal.herdr_session` into `settings.json` and logs the move once. `config.json` is left on disk untouched but is no longer read afterward — it is deprecated.
