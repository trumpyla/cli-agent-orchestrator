# Updating CAO

`cao update` upgrades CAO in place. It reads uv's install receipt
(`<uv tool dir>/cli-agent-orchestrator/uv-receipt.toml`) to detect **how CAO was
installed**, then runs the uv command that actually advances that kind of
install — because a single command (`uv tool upgrade`) does *not* correctly
update every install source.

```bash
cao update
```

## Why the command is source-aware

CAO is installed as a [uv tool](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/), and
uv records the original install source in the receipt. Different sources need
different upgrade actions:

| Installed via | Receipt shape | `cao update` runs | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uv tool install git+…@main` (recommended) | `git = "…?rev=main"` | `uv tool install <git-source> --upgrade --reinstall` | `@main` is a **moving ref**. `uv tool upgrade` treats it as already satisfied ("Nothing to upgrade") and never fetches newer commits, so `--reinstall` is required. |
| `uv tool install cli-agent-orchestrator` | `{ name = "…" }` | `uv tool upgrade cli-agent-orchestrator` | Re-resolves to the latest published release. |
| `uv tool install 'cli-agent-orchestrator==X.Y.Z'` (or any constraint: `<`, `~=`, …) | `specifier = "…"` | `uv tool install cli-agent-orchestrator@latest --upgrade` | **Any version constraint** can hold the install below the latest release, making `uv tool upgrade` a no-op that still reports success; `@latest` unpins to the newest release. |
| `uv tool install .` (local clone) | `directory = "/path"` | *(nothing — prints guidance)* | A local source tree has no remote to advance. `cao update` tells you to update the source and reinstall. |
| `uv tool install ./dist/x.whl` | `path = "/path/x.whl"` | *(nothing — prints guidance)* | A built wheel is a frozen artifact. `cao update` tells you to rebuild and reinstall. |
| `uv tool install --editable .` | `editable = "/path"` | *(nothing — prints guidance)* | An editable clone has no remote to advance. `cao update` tells you to update the source and reinstall **with `--editable`** to preserve the editable install. |

For local installs, `cao update` exits non-zero and prints the exact commands
to run yourself, e.g. for a directory:

```text
update the local source, then reinstall: uv tool install /path --reinstall
(for a git checkout, first run: git -C /path pull)
```

## Requirements and fallbacks

- **uv must be on `PATH`.** `cao update` upgrades the uv tool install; it does
  not manage a `pip install`. If uv is absent, it says so and points you at
  [uv's install docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- **CAO must have been installed as a uv tool.** If it wasn't, `uv` reports the
  install is unknown and `cao update` surfaces that with a non-zero exit —
  update it with the package manager you actually used.
- **A missing, unreadable, or malformed receipt** degrades safely to
  `uv tool upgrade cli-agent-orchestrator` rather than raising a parser
  traceback. (For a *malformed* receipt, `uv tool upgrade` may then reject it
  and exit non-zero with its own message — e.g. "missing a valid receipt" — but
  `cao update` never crashes with a Python traceback.)

## After updating

Restart any running `cao-server` with the same mechanism that started it so the
process picks up the new version.

For a foreground server:

```bash
cao update
# Stop the old foreground process, then:
cao-server
```

For the per-user service installed from a source checkout:

```bash
cao update
scripts/cao-service.sh restart
scripts/cao-service.sh status
```

If the checkout's service-controller files also changed, run
`scripts/cao-service.sh install` instead. Installation refreshes the private
controller copy under `~/.local/libexec/cao-service` and restarts the service
when that runtime changed. It does not rewrite CAO settings, agent profiles, or
the optional `~/.config/cao/service.env`.

See [Per-user `cao-server` service](configuration.md#per-user-cao-server-service)
for lifecycle and diagnostics.
